#### **NONCIRCULAR GEARS**

*Noncircular Gears: Design and Generation* represents the extension of the modern theory of gearing applied to the design and manufacture of the main types of noncircular gears: conventional and modified elliptical gears, eccentric gears, oval gears, gears with lobes, and twisted gears. This book is enhanced by updated theoretical descriptions of the methods of generation of noncircular gears by enveloping methods similar to those applied to the generation of circular gears. *Noncircular Gears: Design and Generation* also offers new developments intended to extend the application of noncircular gears for output speed variation and generation of functions. Numerous numerical examples show the application of the developed theory. This book aims to extend the application of noncircular gear drives in mechanisms and industry.

# <span id="page-12-0"></span>**Foreword**

Noncircular gears (NCG) have been considered a curiosity and a product of niche applications for a long time because of their design and manufacture complexity. However, thanks to the availability of powerful computers and sophisticated CNC machine tools, the design and manufacturing of NCG became more feasible and their potential in many fields can be more easily exploited.

NCG are used to improve the function, versatility, and simplicity of many mechanical processes. For instance, they allow speed matching on assembly lines, linear motion with quick return, and stop-and-dwell motion. Very recent publications highly respected scientific journals show that the interest in NCG is still very strong, for both the theoretical and manufacturing challenges involved, especially in today's high-performance automatic machines.

In this context, this book on NCG is very welcome. It covers all the basic issues of NCG and shows how to solve most of the key problems in NCG design and manufacturing. It clearly presents the foundations of this topic, very useful to the beginner, as well as new and advanced concepts of great importance to both scientists involved in research issues and skillful designers facing NCG sizing and manufacturing. In particular, the book represents the most comprehensive and authoritative treatise on NCG available today for scientists and designers. When complemented with a recently published book, *Gear Geometry and Applied Theory* (2nd ed.) by F. L. Litvin and A. Fuentes (Cambridge University Press, 2004), which provides the fundamentals of all types of gears, the whole field of the theory and applications of gears is covered.

This book on NCG is a bridge between the past and the future of this advanced topic, representing the extension of the existing theory of gearing as it has been developed by Prof. Litvin and his co-authors. In particular, the main contributions of the book can be summarized as follows:

(a) A new algorithm is presented for generation of a given function by any number of gear pairs. It allows more favorable shapes of gear centrodes to be obtained. The analytical solution of this topic did not exist previously.

**xii Foreword**

(b) Design of many types of noncircular gear drives comprising conventional and modified elliptical gears, eccentric circular gears, oval gears, gears with lobes, or internal noncircular gears is covered and their methods of generation by rack cutter, hob, or shaper presented.

- (c) New approaches for the analytical design of centrodes are presented, such as modified elliptical centrodes applied for external and internal gear drives. Most of the transmission functions are represented analytically, allowing conditions for avoiding undercutting and interference to be obtained.
- (d) Finally, tandem design as a combination of a linkage and a gear drive with NCG, as represented in the book, extends the possibility of variation of the output velocity.

Of Prof. Litvin's life and scientific activity much has been said. In particular, after the most striking sentence reported by John J. Coy (*Mechanism and Machine Theory*, Vol. 30, n. 3., pp. 491–492, 1995) in celebration of the eighty-year milestone of Prof. Litvin, which enlightens his extraordinary personality, not too much remains to be added. Indeed, Dr. Coy reported: "At the time when most people are content to put up their feet and rest, Dr. Faydor Litvin has other things he would rather do. ... He is always quick to thank others for their inspiration and support. He is grateful for the health and vigor that has enabled his continued contribution." Now, at the age of 95, he and his co-authors present this new and needed book.

I am not the first to believe that Prof. Litvin is an exceptional scientist and a talented man. He faced the writing of this book with the enthusiasm of a young researcher preparing his first paper, but with the wisdom and high depth of this respectable age spent studying and advancing the modern theory of gears.

The reader will be happy and soon fascinated by this book, and will certainly owe Prof. Litvin and his co-authors for such a remarkable piece of work.

# <span id="page-14-0"></span>**Preface**

The book is written by a group of authors united by application of the same methodology and experience of cooperation for a long time. The contents of the book cover:

- (1) Methods of generation of noncircular gears by enveloping methods that are similar to those applied for generation of circular gears. However, the motions of the generating tools (rack cutter, shaper, or hob) are nonlinear and must be computerized.
- (2) Design of noncircular gears to be applied for variation of output speed and generation of functions. Such a design requires determination of mating centrodes that roll over each other.
- (3) Detailed procedure of design of elliptical gears with spur and helical teeth, oval gears, lobes, eccentric involute gears, and twisted gears (applied for extension of the interval of function generation).
- (4) Tandem design of planar linkages coupled with noncircular gears for a broader variation range of the output speed.

The authors hope that this book will allow extension of application and design of noncircular gear drives in mechanisms and industry.

#### **1.1 Historical Comments**

Designers have tried for many years to apply noncircular gears in automatic machines and instruments. The obstacle was the lack of effective methods of generation of noncircular gears similar to those applied for the generation of circular gears. However, researchers have continued the investigation of application of noncircular gears – see the earlier works by Burmester [\(Burmester, 1888\)](#page-218-2), Golber (Golber, [1939\), T](#page-218-3)emperley [\(Temperley, 1948\)](#page-219-0), or Boyd [\(Boyd, 1940\)](#page-218-4) – and manufacturers have intensified their efforts for improvement of the generation of noncircular gears [\(Fellows, 1924;](#page-218-5) [Bopp & Reuther G.m.b.H., 1938\)](#page-218-6).

Due to the lack of exact methods of generation of noncircular gears, the efforts were first directed to the development of methods based on the meshing of generating tools with master gears. Figure [1.1.1](#page-19-0) shows the Fellows' approach where the noncircular master gear 1 is in mesh with a master rack [\(Fellows, 1924\)](#page-218-5). The rack cutter and gear being generated are denoted by 3 and 4, respectively.

Bopp and Reuther's approach (Fig. [1.1.2\)](#page-19-1) is based on the simulation of meshing of a noncircular master worm gear *c* with a worm *f* that is identical to the hob *d*; *a* is the spur noncircular gear being generated; the cam *b* and the follower *e* form the cam mechanism designated for simulation of the required variable distance between *c* and *f* [\(Bopp & Reuther G.m.b.H., 1938\)](#page-218-6). Weight *g* maintains the continuous contact between the cam and the follower. However, both approaches were difficult to apply due to the necessity of manufacturing noncircular master gears, which was expensive and time-consuming.

The breakthrough of generation of noncircular gears happened in years 1949– 1951, wherein enveloping methods of generation of noncircular gears were developed based on generation by a rack cutter, hob, or a shaper (Litvin *et al.*[, 1949 t](#page-218-8)o [1951](#page-218-7)). Such methods were based on obtaining the gear tooth surface as the envelope to the family of tool surfaces and are based on the following ideas:

(a) The noncircular gears are generated by the same tools (rack cutters, hobs, and shapers) that are used for the manufacture of circular gears.

- <span id="page-19-0"></span>(b) Conjugated tooth shapes for noncircular gears are provided due to the imaginary rolling of the tool centrode over the given gear centrode.
- (c) The imaginary rolling of the tool centrode over the centrode of the gear being generated is accomplished by proper relations between the motions of the tool and the gear in the process of cutting.

We illustrate the developed approaches in Fig. [1.1.3,](#page-20-0) which shows that mating noncircular centrodes 1 and 2 are in mesh with a conventional rack cutter 3. The centrode of the rack cutter is a straight line *t* − *t* that is a common tangent to centrodes 1 and 2 and rolls over 1 and 2. Rolling of centrode 3 of the rack cutter is

Figure 1.1.3. Illustration of generation of noncircular gears 1 and 2 by rack cutter 3.

<span id="page-20-1"></span><span id="page-20-0"></span>achieved wherein the rack cutter translates along tangent  $\overline{t-t}$  and is rotated about the instantaneous center of rotation I (Fig. 1.1.3). Tooth surfaces of gear 1, gear 2, and rack cutter 3 are in mesh simultaneously, and gear 1 and 2 are provided with conjugated surfaces.

Drawings of Fig. 1.1.4 show the related motions of a rack cutter being in mesh with one of the noncircular gears of the pair of noncircular gears shown in Fig. 1.1.3. Figure 1.1.4(a) shows that the rack cutter translates along  $\overline{t-t}$ , which is the common tangent to the rack cutter centrode 2 and centrode 1 of the noncircular gear. Centrode 2 is a straight line. Centrode 1 applied for generation is the same as that applied in the meshing of two mating noncircular gears, as shown in Fig. 1.1.3.

The noncircular gear 1 being in mesh with rack cutter 2 performs two related motions during the process of generation (Fig. 1.1.4(a)): (a) rotation about  $O_1$  with angular velocity  $\mathbf{w}^{(1)}$ , and (b) translational motion with linear velocity  $\mathbf{v}^{(1)}_{tr}$  in a direction that is perpendicular to  $\overline{t-t}$ . Rolling of the rack cutter 2 about centrode 1 is provided by observation of the vector equation

$$\mathbf{v}^{(2)} = \mathbf{v}_{rot}^{(1)} + \mathbf{v}_{tr}^{(1)} \tag{1.1.1}$$

We may consider that the translation of the rack cutter is performed with a constant velocity  $\mathbf{v}^{(2)}$ , and the motions of the noncircular gear are provided by observation of the nonlinear function  $\boldsymbol{\omega}^{(1)}(\mathbf{v}^{(2)})$  and  $\mathbf{v}_{tr}^{(1)}(\mathbf{v}^{(2)})$ .

Three coordinate systems are applied for generation: (i) movable ones,  $S_2$  and  $S_1$ , rigidly connected to the rack cutter 2 and noncircular gear 1 (Fig. 1.1.4(b)), and (ii) fixed coordinate system  $S_f$ , in which we consider the motions of  $S_2$  and  $S_1$  (Fig. 1.1.4(b)). Symbols  $x_f^{(O_2)}$  and  $y_f^{(O_1)}$  denote the displacements of the rack cutter and noncircular gear, respectively. Angle  $\phi_1$  denotes the rotation of the gear.

<span id="page-21-1"></span><span id="page-21-0"></span>Figure 1.1.4. Toward derivation of related motions of rack cutter 2 and noncircular gear 1.

The derivations of the nonlinear functions  $\phi_1(x_f^{(O_2)})$  and  $y_f^{(O_1)}(x_f^{(O_2)})$  are presented in Chapter 5. Initially, observation of functions mentioned previously has been accomplished by the remodeling of existing equipment and using cam mechanisms for the generation of the required functions. Figure 1.1.5 shows the first cutting machine for noncircular gears applied in 1951. At present, observation of functions  $\phi_1(x_f^{(O_2)})$  and  $y_f^{(O_1)}(x_f^{(O_2)})$  is obtained by computer controlled machines (Smith, 1995).

By using enveloping methods of generation of noncircular gears, various new types of noncircular gears have been developed with closed and non-closed centrodes. An example of a pair of noncircular gears with non-closed centrodes applied for generation of a given function y(x) represented in the closed interval  $[x_1, x_2]$ , if  $y(x_1) \neq y(x_2)$  (see Chapter 10), is shown in Fig. 1.1.6.

Figure 1.1.7 shows a 3D model of a helical elliptical gear. It has found good application for the driving of a crank-slider mechanism in heavy-press machines.

It can be used as well in tandem design of the Scotch-Yoke mechanism coupled with eccentric involute gears to obtain an improved function of the output velocity.

#### **1.2 Toward Design and Application of Noncircular Gears**

#### **1.2.1 Examples of Previous Designs**

Noncircular gears have found application in the industry for (i) variation of the output speed (for instance, in presses, conveyers, rice planting machines, etc.) and

The contents of this section cover only a small number of examples of the previous design of mechanisms with noncircular gears. Figure [1.2.1](#page-19-0) shows application of a gear drive with elliptical gears applied for driving a Maltese cross mechanism. The Maltese cross mechanism, also known as the Geneva mechanism, is used to convert a continuous rotary motion into an intermittent rotary motion, and it is applied in many instruments or in other applications where an intermittent rotary motion is required. The purpose of the design shown in Fig. [1.2.1](#page-19-0) is obtaining lower and higher speeds for the working and free-running parts of the cycle.

Figure [1.2.2](#page-19-1) shows examples of noncircular gears applied in the past in fine mechanics for the generation of functions of one variable. The development of electronic ways of generation of functions has eliminated such an approach. Figure [1.2.3](#page-20-1) shows a comparatively modern example of the application of oval gears in flowmeters, proposed by Bopp and Reuthers [\(Bopp & Reuther G.m.b.H., 1938\)](#page-218-6). The oval shape of the centrodes is obtained by modification of a conventional ellipse (see Section [4.3.5\)](#page-74-2).

Figure [1.2.4](#page-21-0) illustrates the possibility of application of twisted centrodes, which allow an increasing of the interval of the function to be generated. The gears with such centrodes may perform during the process of meshing an angle of rotation φ > 2π but, in addition to rotation, the gears have to perform an axial displacement. Figure [1.2.5](#page-22-2) shows the centrodes of gears for generation of function *y*(*x*) = 1/*x* for 1 ≤ *x* ≤ 3 and φ<sup>1</sup>*max* = 5π.

parts of the cycle of the slider, with a lower and higher speed (for the working and free-running parts of the cycle). For applications in which there is a need to obtain a nonsymmetrical cycle of the slider, with a slow-working cycle and a fast free-running cycle, application of modified elliptical gears will be considered.

#### **1.2.2 Examples of New Designs**

New developments based on the modification of conventional ellipses have been accomplished. These new designs cover oval gears (Fig. [1.2.7\)](#page-23-3), gears with lobe[s1](#page-28-2) (Fig. [1.2.8\)](#page-24-1), or conjugation of an ellipse with a driven gear wherein the driving gear 1 performs more than one revolution for each revolution of the driven gear (Fig. [1.2.9\)](#page-29-0).

The following examples illustrate the advantages of the tandem design of mechanisms with noncircular gears. Figure [1.2.10](#page-30-0) shows the tandem design of a slidercrank linkage and a pair of modified elliptical gears to be applied in those applications wherein differences in the governing function corresponding to the approach stroke and to the return stroke is the goal. Figure [1.2.10\(](#page-30-0)a) shows the centrodes of the modified elliptical gears, and Fig. [1.2.10\(](#page-30-0)b) shows the unmodified *s*(β) and modified *s*(α) governing functions of the slider-crank linkage. In this case, a longer approach stroke for the slider is obtained with a fast return stroke of the slider.

Another example of a new design is the Scotch-Yoke mechanism (Fig. [1.2.11\(](#page-31-2)a)) coupled with noncircular gears for the variation of output speed. Figure [1.2.11\(](#page-31-2)b) shows the relation between velocities, and Fig. [1.2.12](#page-32-0) shows the shape of a transported textile ball as a function of v7(φ1).

A significant achievement is the generation of a given function by a multigear drive. The theoretical basis of this approach is the analytical solution of the functional

The figure illustrates a particular case of solution of the functional [\(1.2.1\)](#page-29-1). The great advantage of application of a multigear drive formed by noncircular gears is the reduction of the pressure angle of the centrodes and their favorable shape (see Chapter [10\)](#page-164-2).

#### **1.3 Developments Related with Theory of Gearing**

Teeth of the same noncircular gear have different profiles, and this is the main difference between a circular and noncircular gear. The geometry of teeth and their profiles must be based on the concepts applied in differential geometry for planar curves.

<span id="page-32-2"></span><span id="page-32-1"></span>![](_page_32_Figure_2.jpeg)

**TANGENT TO CENTRODES.** The consideration of centrodes represented in polar form is preferable to study the geometry of noncircular gears. The orientation of the tangent to the centrode is determined by the angle µ formed by the position vector to the centrode and the tangent (see Section [2.5\)](#page-39-2).

<span id="page-33-0"></span>Figure 1.2.13. Illustration of a gear drive formed by three pairs of noncircular gears for the generation of given function ψ(α).

**CURVATURE OF CENTRODES.** Determination of the curvature of centrodes of noncircular gears is necessary for the choice of the generating tool (rack cutter, hob, or shaper) that can be applied for the generation of noncircular gears and for the avoidance of undercutting. Equations for the determination of the curvature of a <span id="page-34-2"></span><span id="page-34-1"></span>polar curve are presented in Section 2.8 and the conditions for the observation of convexity of centrodes are formulated.

**EVOLUTE AND INVOLUTE OF PROFILES OF TEETH.** The evolute for profiles of a tooth is determined as the sequence of centers of curvature determined for the points of the profiles of the tooth. Each profile of the tooth of a noncircular gear has its evolute. Profiles of both sides of a tooth have different evolutes. The evolute for all profiles of the teeth of the same circular gear is the same curve and is called the *base circle*.

The concept of evolute may be described geometrically as follows: (i) determine at each point of the tooth profile the normal to the profile – the sequence of normals will form a family of straight lines; (ii) the envelope to the family of normals is the evolute.

The tooth profile is a curve that may be called *involute*. Tooth profiles of the same noncircular gear are represented by different curves (different involutes).

**IDENTITY OF MATING CENTRODES.** The generation of a function is performed by the meshing of two conjugated centrodes and, generally, the mating centrodes are not identical. However, in some particular cases the mating centrodes might be identical by observation of certain requirements for the transmission function of mating centrodes (see Section 4.5).

MATRIX APPROACH FOR DERIVATION OF EQUATION OF MESHING. The gear tooth surface  $\Sigma_g$  generated by the tool surface  $\Sigma_t$  is determined as the envelope to the family of tool surfaces in a coordinate system fixed to the gear (Litvin & Fuentes, 2004). The applied procedure requires determination of the equation of meshing of surfaces  $\Sigma_g$  and  $\Sigma_t$ .

The most effective way to derive the equation of meshing is based on the application of the scalar product

<span id="page-34-0"></span>
$$\mathbf{r}_{t}(u,\theta) \cdot \mathbf{v}_{r}^{(t,g)} = f(u,\theta,\phi) = 0$$
(1.3.1)

where  $\mathbf{r}_t(u,\theta)$  is the tool surface represented in two-parameter form (by parameters  $(u,\theta)$ ) and  $\mathbf{v}_r^{(t,g)}$  is the velocity in relative motion. Determination of Eq. (1.3.1) has been based on differentiation of the matrices that describe the coordinate transformation (see Section 5.2).

**AVOIDANCE OF UNDERCUTTING.** The proposed approach is based on representation of profiles of teeth of a noncircular gear by a set of profiles of teeth of circular gears (see Section 4.3.2.2).

#### **2.1 Introduction**

Noncircular gears are mainly designed for the transformation of rotation between parallel axes with a constant center distance performed with variation of ratio of angular velocities ω(1)/ω(2).

Figure [2.1.1](#page-36-0) shows schematically the transformation of rotation of centrodes of noncircular gears. Planes <sup>1</sup> and <sup>2</sup> (Fig. [2.1.1\(](#page-36-0)a)) are perpendicular to axes (*a* − *a*) and (*b* − *b*) (Fig. [2.1.1\(](#page-36-0)b)), respectively, of gear rotation. The rotation of gear 1 is performed counterclockwise as shown by arc *a* and rotation of gear 2 is performed clockwise as shown by arc *b* (Fig. [2.1.1\(](#page-36-0)a)). Vector **v**(*i*) (*i* = 1, 2) of linear velocity of rotation of a point of gear belongs to plane *<sup>i</sup>* . Vectors *ω*(1) and *ω*(2) of angular velocities of gear rotation are directed along the axes of rotation (Fig. [2.1.1\(](#page-36-0)b)).

The centrodes are planar curves that roll over each other in the process of transformation of rotation. Figure [2.1.2](#page-36-1) shows an example of centrodes of elliptical noncircular gears. The centrodes contact each other in the process of transformation of rotation at a point *I* that moves along *O*<sup>1</sup> − *O*<sup>2</sup> (Fig. [2.1.1\(](#page-36-0)a)). Vectors **v**(1) and **v**(2) represent the linear velocities of rotation about *O*<sup>1</sup> and *O*2, respectively, and are determined as

$$\mathbf{v}^{(1)} = \boldsymbol{\omega}^{(1)} \times \overline{O_1 I}, \qquad \mathbf{v}^{(2)} = \boldsymbol{\omega}^{(2)} \times \overline{O_2 I}$$
 (2.1.1)

The condition of rolling of centrodes is observed by the vector equation

<span id="page-35-2"></span>
$$\mathbf{v}^{(1)} = \mathbf{v}^{(2)} \tag{2.1.2}$$

Equation [\(2.1.2\)](#page-35-2) shows that the relative velocity at the point of tangency of centrodes is equal to zero. Thus, the condition of rolling of centrodes is observed by the vector equation

$$\mathbf{v}^{(12)} = \mathbf{v}^{(1)} - \mathbf{v}^{(2)} = \mathbf{0} \tag{2.1.3}$$

Similarly, we have

$$\mathbf{v}^{(21)} = \mathbf{v}^{(2)} - \mathbf{v}^{(1)} = \mathbf{0} \tag{2.1.4}$$

Figure 2.2.1. Illustration of fixed coordinate system *Sf*(*xf* , *yf*) and movable coordinate systems *S*1(*x*1, *y*1), *S*2(*x*2, *y*2).

Point *I* of the tangency of centrodes is the instantaneous center of rotation in relative motion. Considering that one of the centrodes is held at rest, for instance centrode 2, then we may consider that centrode 1 is rotated about centrode 2 at point *I* (Fig. [2.1.1\(](#page-36-0)b)) with angular velocity |*ω*(12)|=|*ω*(1)|+|*ω*(2)|.

#### **2.2 Centrode as the Trajectory of the Instantaneous Center of Rotation**

The determination of centrodes is the first step in the design of noncircular gears, and for this purpose we apply: (i) two movable coordinate systems *S*1(*x*1, *y*1) and *S*2(*x*2, *y*2) rigidly connected with gears 1 and 2, and (ii) a fixed coordinate system *Sf*(*x <sup>f</sup>* , *yf*) rigidly connected to the frame of the gear drive (see Figure [2.2.1\)](#page-36-0).

During the transformation of rotation of noncircular gears 1 and 2, the instantaneous center of rotation *I* moves along center distance *E*, and the trajectory traced out by the instantaneous center of rotation in *Sf* is represented as the straight line **r***f*(*u*) where *u* = |*O*<sup>1</sup> *I*|.

Simultaneously, the instantaneous center of rotation moves in coordinate systems *S*1(*x*1, *y*1) and *S*2(*x*2, *y*2) along centrodes σ<sup>1</sup> and σ<sup>2</sup> of gears 1 and 2.

We may determine the centrodes as trajectories traced out by point *I* in coordinate systems *S*<sup>1</sup> and *S*2, respectively, and represented as

$$\mathbf{r}_1(u,\phi_1) = \mathbf{M}_{1f}(\phi_1)\mathbf{r}_f(u)$$
 (2.2.1)

$$\mathbf{r}_2(u,\phi_2) = \mathbf{M}_{2f}(\phi_2)\mathbf{r}_f(u)$$
 (2.2.2)

Matrices **M***i f*(*i* = 1, 2) represent the coordinate transformation from *Sf* to *Si* (*i* = 1, 2).

Figure 2.3.1. Illustration of polar axis *O*1*A*, center distance *E*, rotation angle φ1, and parameter θ1.

### **2.3 Concept of Polar Curve**

The centrodes are determined as polar curves. Figure [2.3.1](#page-36-2) shows (i) the polar axis *O*1*A* of a driving centrode that passes through its center of rotation *O*1; (ii) *E* = |*O*1*O*2| is the shortest center distance between centrodes 1 and 2, where *O*<sup>2</sup> is the center of rotation of centrode 2; (iii)*r*1(θ1) is the position vector of centrode 1, where θ<sup>1</sup> is the angle formed by polar axis *O*1*A* and the center distance |*O*1*O*2|; parameter θ<sup>1</sup> is measured clockwise, and function *r*1(θ1) determines centrode 1 as a polar curve; (iv) φ<sup>1</sup> is the angle of rotation of centrode 1 measured counterclockwise (φ<sup>1</sup> = θ1).

#### <span id="page-38-6"></span><span id="page-38-5"></span>**2.4 Derivation of Centrodes**

We consider the following cases of the derivation of centrodes (i) wherein the derivative function *m*12(φ1) = *d*φ1/*d*φ<sup>2</sup> and the center distance of the gear drive with noncircular gears are given, and (ii) wherein function *y*(*x*), *x*<sup>1</sup> ≤ *x* ≤ *x*2, which must be generated by the mechanism of noncircular gears, is given.

#### **CASE 1: DERIVATION OF CENTRODES CONSIDERING AS GIVEN FUNCTION** *m***12(***φ***1)**

**Step 1.** Taking into account that

<span id="page-38-4"></span>
$$m_{12}(\phi_1) = \frac{d\phi_1}{d\phi_2} = \frac{r_2}{r_1} = \frac{E - r_1}{r_1}$$
 (2.4.1)

we obtain the following expression for centrode 1 (centrode σ1):

<span id="page-38-3"></span>
$$r_1(\phi_1) = \frac{E}{1 + m_{12}(\phi_1)} \tag{2.4.2}$$

<span id="page-39-16"></span><span id="page-39-15"></span><span id="page-39-1"></span><span id="page-39-0"></span>Taking into account that  $\phi_1 = \theta_1$ , we obtain the polar equation of  $\sigma_1$ 

<span id="page-39-3"></span>
$$r_1(\theta_1) = \frac{E}{1 + m_{12}(\theta_1)} \tag{2.4.3}$$

**Step 2.** Centrode 2 (centrode  $\sigma_2$ ) is determined by the equations

<span id="page-39-6"></span><span id="page-39-4"></span>
$$r_2(\phi_1) = E \frac{m_{12}(\phi_1)}{1 + m_{12}(\phi_1)}$$
 (2.4.4)

<span id="page-39-7"></span><span id="page-39-5"></span>
$$\phi_2(\phi_1) = \int_0^{\phi_1} \frac{d\phi_1}{m_{12}(\phi_1)} \tag{2.4.5}$$

The derivative function  $m_{12}(\phi_1)$  must be a smooth, differentiable, and positive function. The requirement of positive values of  $m_{12}(\phi_1)$  in the area  $\phi_1^{(1)} \le \phi \le \phi_1^{(2)}$  must be observed because the rotation of the gears may be performed in one direction only as a continued one (see Section 10.3 on generation of non-monotonous functions). Variation of the magnitude of  $m_{12}(\phi_1)$  may be accompanied with an unfavorable magnitude of the pressure angle, which may require the design of a mechanism with more than one pair of mating gears.

#### CASE 2: DERIVATION OF CENTRODES CONSIDERING AS GIVEN FUNCTION y(x), $x_1 \le x \le x_2$

**Step 1.** The angles of rotation of the driving and driven gears are proportional to x and f(x), respectively. We then obtain the following equations for the scalar coefficients  $k_1$  and  $k_2$ :

<span id="page-39-13"></span><span id="page-39-12"></span><span id="page-39-10"></span><span id="page-39-8"></span>
$$\phi_1 = k_1(x - x_1) \tag{2.4.6}$$

$$\phi_2 = k_2 [f(x) - f(x_1)]$$
 (2.4.7)

**Step 2.** The gear ratio is determined as

<span id="page-39-14"></span><span id="page-39-9"></span>
$$m_{12}(x) = \frac{d\phi_1}{d\phi_2} = \frac{k_1}{k_2 f'(x)}$$
 (2.4.8)

The following requirements must be observed:

- (i) The derivative function  $m_{12}(x)$ ,  $x_1 \le x \le x_2$ , must be positive.
- (ii) The pressure angle (see Section 4.3.2.2) should not exceed the limiting values.

Such requirements may be fulfilled by:

- (a) Application of multithread noncircular gears wherein  $\phi_{1max} \ge 2\pi$  (see Fig. 1.2.4).
- (b) Use of a gear mechanism with more than one pair of gears (see Section 10.5).

Figure 2.5.1 shows polar axis  $\overline{OA}$  and two points  $M_0$  and  $M_2$  of the polar curve infinitesimally close to each other. Vector  $\mathbf{t}$  is the tangent to the polar curve at point  $M_0$ .

<span id="page-40-2"></span>
$$\tan \mu = \frac{r}{dr/d\theta} \tag{2.5.1}$$

Angle µ (Fig. [2.5.1\)](#page-40-1) is formed by extended position vector *OM*<sup>0</sup> and tangent **t**. Equation [\(2.5.1\)](#page-40-2) is the basic equation for the determination of tangent **t** to polar curve. Tangent **t** to a polar curve is directed in accordance to measurements of polar angle θ (Fig. [2.5.1\)](#page-40-1). Figure [2.5.2\(](#page-41-2)a) shows two mating centrodes σ<sup>1</sup> and σ<sup>2</sup> that contact each other at the instantaneous center of rotation *I*. The common tangent to the centrodes is **t**. Parameters φ*<sup>i</sup>* and θ*<sup>i</sup>* (*i* = 1, 2) represent the angles of rotation of centrodes and scalar parameters.

Our goal is to prove that angles µ<sup>1</sup> and µ<sup>2</sup> (Figs. [2.5.2\(](#page-41-2)b) and [2.5.2\(](#page-41-2)c)) are related at point *I* of tangency of centrodes σ<sup>1</sup> and σ<sup>2</sup> as

<span id="page-40-3"></span>
$$\mu_1 + \mu_2 = \pi \tag{2.5.2}$$

(i) Centrode σ<sup>1</sup> is represented by Eq. [\(2.4.3\)](#page-39-3). Following Eq. [\(2.5.1\)](#page-40-2), we obtain

$$\tan \mu_1 = \frac{r_1(\theta_1)}{dr_1/d\theta_1} = -\frac{1 + m_{12}(\theta_1)}{dm_{12}(\theta_1)/d\theta_1}$$
 (2.5.3)

(ii) Centrode σ<sup>2</sup> is represented by Eqs. [\(2.4.4\)](#page-39-4) and [\(2.4.5\)](#page-39-5). Taking into account that φ<sup>1</sup> = θ1, we obtain tanµ<sup>2</sup> = − tanµ1, and Eq. [\(2.5.2\)](#page-40-3) is observed.

#### <span id="page-41-6"></span><span id="page-41-5"></span><span id="page-41-2"></span>**2.6 Conditions for Design of Centrodes as Closed Form Curves**

Mechanisms applied in automatic machines are designed for continuous motion, and the centrodes must be designed as closed curves. The conditions of obtaining centrodes as closed curves are formulated below (i) for a conventional mechanism designed for transformation of motions, and (ii) for a mechanism designed for generation of a given function. Conditions of obtaining closed curves are formulated for the driving and driven gear separately.

**DESIGN OF CENTRODE 1.** We recall that centrode *r*1(θ1) (θ<sup>1</sup> = φ1) is represented by Eq. [\(2.4.2\)](#page-38-3). This equation shows that centrode 1 may be obtained as a closed form curve if *m*12(φ1) is a periodic function with period *T* = *T*1/*n*1, where *T*<sup>1</sup> is the period of revolution of gear 1 and *n*<sup>1</sup> is an integer number.

**DESIGN OF CENTRODE 2.** The centrode is determined by Eqs. [\(2.4.4\)](#page-39-6) and [\(2.4.5\)](#page-39-7). Equation [\(2.4.4\)](#page-39-6) yields that centrode 2, *r*2(φ1), is a closed form curve if *m*12(φ1) is a periodic function with the period *T* = *T*1/*n*1. This means that the interval of variation of φ<sup>1</sup> during one revolution is a multiple of 2π/*n*1.

In addition, the following requirements must be observed:

(i) The ratio between the revolutions *n*<sup>1</sup> and *n*<sup>2</sup> of centrodes 1 and 2, respectively, must be

<span id="page-41-4"></span><span id="page-41-3"></span>
$$\frac{T_1}{n_1} = \frac{T_2}{n_2} \tag{2.6.1}$$

where *n*<sup>1</sup> and *n*<sup>2</sup> are integer numbers.

- <span id="page-42-8"></span>(ii) The gear center distance E must be determined as a function of  $n_1$  and  $n_2$  as follows:
  - (a) We represent  $r_2(\phi_1)$  by the equation

$$r_2(\phi_1) = E - r_1(\phi_1) \tag{2.6.2}$$

(b) The angle  $\phi_2$  of rotation of gear 2 is determined as

<span id="page-42-3"></span><span id="page-42-0"></span>
$$\phi_2(\phi_1) = \int_0^{\phi_1} \frac{d\phi_1}{m_{12}(\phi_1)} = \int_0^{\phi_1} \frac{r_1(\phi_1)}{r_2(\phi_1)} d\phi_1 = \int_0^{\phi_1} \frac{r_1(\phi_1)}{E - r_1(\phi_1)} d\phi_1 \qquad (2.6.3)$$

Observation of Eqs. (2.6.1) and (2.6.3) yields the following equation for the determination of center distance E:

<span id="page-42-1"></span>
$$\phi_2 = \frac{2\pi}{n_2} = \int_0^{\frac{2\pi}{n_1}} \frac{r_1(\phi_1)}{E - r_1(\phi_1)} d\phi_1$$
 (2.6.4)

The design of gears with closed form centrodes requires observation of Eqs. (2.6.1) and (2.6.4) and is discussed in Chapter 4 for conventional and modified elliptical gears, in Chapter 6 for eccentric involute gear drives, and in Chapter 7 for internal gear drives.

Problem 2.6.1 and its solution are provided for the comprehension of approaches applied for the design of noncircular gear drives.

**PROBLEM 2.6.1. TOWARD DESIGN OF A GEAR DRIVE WITH ELLIPTICAL PINION.** The design of centrodes of gear drives with conventional and modified elliptical centrodes may be performed analytically by application of the following integrals represented by Dwight (Dwight, 1961):

<span id="page-42-7"></span><span id="page-42-4"></span>
$$\int_0^\pi \frac{dx}{1 \pm a \cos x} = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{1 - a^2}} \tag{2.6.5}$$

$$\int \frac{dx}{a + b\cos x} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{a^2 - b^2}} \arctan \frac{(a - b)\tan \frac{x}{2}}{\sqrt{a^2 - b^2}} \qquad [a^2 > b^2] \quad (2.6.6)$$

#### **Step 1.** Centrode $\sigma_1$ .

Centrode  $\sigma_1$  is a conventional ellipse, and the center of rotation is the lower focus of the ellipse. The polar equation of centrode  $\sigma_1$  is then (see Section 4.2)

<span id="page-42-6"></span><span id="page-42-5"></span><span id="page-42-2"></span>
$$r_1(\phi_1) = \frac{p}{1 - e\cos\phi_1} = \frac{a(1 - e^2)}{1 - e\cos\phi_1}, \qquad 0 \le \phi_1 \le 2\pi n$$
 (2.6.7)

Here, a is the larger axis of the ellipse, e = c/a is the eccentricity of the ellipse with 2c being the distance between the focuses of the ellipse, n is the number of revolutions that centrode  $\sigma_1$  performs for one revolution of conjugated centrode  $\sigma_2$ , and  $\phi_1$  is the angle of rotation of  $\sigma_1$  (Fig. 2.6.1). The centrode  $\sigma_1$  is already a closed form curve.

Determination of centrode  $\sigma_2$  as a closed form curve is discussed in the following.

#### **Step 2.** Derivative function $m_{21}(\phi_1)$ .

The derivation of  $m_{21}(\phi_1)$  is based on application of Eqs. (2.6.7) and (2.4.1), which yield

$$m_{21}(\phi_1) = \frac{1}{m_{12}(\phi_1)} = \frac{p}{E - p - Ee \cos \phi_1}$$
$$= \left(\frac{p}{E - p}\right) \frac{1}{1 - q \cos \phi_1}, \quad q = \frac{Ee}{E - p}$$
(2.6.8)

#### **Step 3.** Derivation of center distance E.

The derivation of E is based on the Eqs. (2.6.1) and (2.6.3), which yield

<span id="page-43-3"></span><span id="page-43-1"></span>
$$\phi_2(\phi_1)_{\phi_1=2\pi} = 2\pi = n \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{p}{E - p - Ee \cos \phi_1} d\phi_1$$

$$= \left(\frac{pn}{E - p}\right) \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{d\phi_1}{1 - q \cos \phi_1} = \frac{2pn}{E - p} \int_0^{\pi} \frac{d\phi_1}{1 - q \cos \phi_1}$$
 (2.6.9)

where n is the number of revolutions of pinion centrode  $\sigma_1$  performed for one revolution of gear centrode  $\sigma_2$ . By applying Eq. (2.6.5), Eq. (2.6.9) yields the following quadratic equation:

<span id="page-43-2"></span>
$$E^{2}(1 - e^{2}) - 2Ep + p^{2}(1 - n^{2}) = 0 (2.6.10)$$

<span id="page-44-6"></span><span id="page-44-5"></span><span id="page-44-1"></span><span id="page-44-0"></span>The solution of Eq. [\(2.6.10\)](#page-43-2) for *E* is

<span id="page-44-3"></span>
$$E = a \left[ 1 + \sqrt{1 + (1 - e^2)(n^2 - 1)} \right]$$
 (2.6.11)

The importance of Eq. [\(2.6.11\)](#page-44-3) is that it works for conventional elliptic gear drives, modified elliptical gear drives, oval gears, and for gears with lobes (see Chapter [4\)](#page-57-2).

**Step 4.** Centrode σ<sup>2</sup> of driven gear.

Centrode σ<sup>2</sup> is represented by the following equations:

$$r_2(\phi_1) = E - r_1(\phi_1) = E - \frac{a(1 - e^2)}{1 - e\cos\phi_1}$$
 (2.6.12)

$$\phi_2(\phi_1) = \int_0^{\phi_1} m_{21}(\phi_1) d\phi_1 = \left(\frac{p}{E-p}\right) \int_0^{\phi_1} \frac{d\phi_1}{1 - q\cos\phi_1}$$
 (2.6.13)

The transmission function [\(2.6.9\)](#page-43-3) may be determined analytically using Eq. [\(2.6.6\)](#page-42-5). We then obtain the following expression for φ2(φ1):

$$\tan\frac{\phi_2}{2} = \left(\frac{1+e}{1-e}\right)\tan\frac{\phi_1}{2} \tag{2.6.14}$$

#### **2.7 Observation of Closed Centrodes for Function Generation**

Basic ideas of the application of noncircular gears for generation of the function of *y*(*x*), *x*<sup>1</sup> ≤ *x* ≤ *x*2, are formulated by Eqs. [\(2.4.6\)](#page-39-8) to [\(2.4.8\)](#page-39-9). The following conditions must be observed to obtain closed form centrodes for generation of the function in addition to the previously mentioned equations:

- (a) The derivative function *y* (*x*) must be periodic and of period *<sup>x</sup>*<sup>2</sup> <sup>−</sup> *<sup>x</sup>*<sup>1</sup> *n*1 , where *n*<sup>1</sup> is an integer number.
- (b) The scalar coefficients *k*<sup>1</sup> and *k*<sup>2</sup> of Eqs. [\(2.4.6\)](#page-39-8) and [\(2.4.7\)](#page-39-10) must satisfy the following relations:

$$k_1 = \frac{2\pi}{x_2 - x_1} \tag{2.7.1}$$

$$k_2 = \frac{2\pi}{f(x_2) - f(x_1)} \tag{2.7.2}$$

## <span id="page-44-4"></span><span id="page-44-2"></span>**2.8 Basic and Alternative Equations of Curvature of Polar Curve**

Determination of the curvature of centrodes of noncircular gears is required for the solution of the following problems:

- (i) Determination of the type of generating tool (rack cutter, hob, or shaper) that can be applied for generation of noncircular gears. A rack cutter or a hob may be applied only for convex centrodes.
- (ii) Avoidance of undercutting (see Section [4.3.2.2\)](#page-64-2).

<span id="page-45-3"></span>![](_page_45_Picture_2.jpeg)

Figure 2.8.1. For derivation of the curvature of polar curve: (a)  $\overline{OA}$  is the polar axis,  $r(\theta)$  is the position vector,  $\rho$  is the curvature radius, and C is the curvature center; (b)  $ds = \widehat{M_1 M_2}$ , and  $r(\theta)d\theta$  and dr are the arc components of  $\widehat{M_1 M_2}$ ,

Figure 2.8.1(a) shows a polar curve wherein  $\overline{CM_1}$  and  $\overline{CM_2}$  are the normals to the curve that form angle  $(d\theta + d\mu)$  and C is the curvature center. The length ds of the small arc  $\widehat{M_1M_2}$  is determined as (Fig. 2.8.1(b))

<span id="page-45-0"></span>
$$ds = \sqrt{[r(\theta)d\theta]^2 + (dr)^2} = r(\theta)\sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{dr/d\theta}{r(\theta)}\right)^2}d\theta$$
$$= r(\theta)\sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{\tan^2 \mu}}d\theta = \frac{r(\theta)}{\sin \mu}d\theta \tag{2.8.1}$$

Considering  $\widehat{M_1M_2}$  as the small arc of radius  $\rho$ , we represent ds as

<span id="page-45-1"></span>
$$ds = \rho(d\theta + d\mu) \tag{2.8.2}$$

Equations (2.8.1) and (2.8.2) yield

<span id="page-45-2"></span>
$$\rho(\theta) = \frac{r(\theta)}{\sin \mu} \left( \frac{d\theta}{d\theta + d\mu} \right)$$
 (2.8.3)

Determination of function  $d\mu/d\theta=f(\theta)$  is based on the following considerations:

<span id="page-46-7"></span>(i) We recall that  $\tan \mu = \frac{r}{dr/d\theta}$  (see Eq. (2.5.1)). After differentiation, we obtain

<span id="page-46-6"></span>
$$d\mu = \frac{\cos^2 \mu \left[ \left( \frac{dr}{d\theta} \right)^2 - r \frac{d^2 r}{d\theta^2} \right]}{\left( \frac{dr}{d\theta} \right)^2} d\theta$$
 (2.8.4)

(ii) Continuing transformations, we obtain

<span id="page-46-0"></span>
$$d\mu + d\theta = \frac{\cos^2 \mu \left[ \left( \frac{dr}{d\theta} \right)^2 - r \frac{d^2 r}{d\theta^2} \right] + \left( \frac{dr}{d\theta} \right)^2}{\left( \frac{dr}{d\theta} \right)^2} d\theta \tag{2.8.5}$$

(iii) Equations (2.8.5) and (2.5.1) yield

<span id="page-46-1"></span>
$$d\mu + d\theta = \frac{r(\theta)(2 - \sin^2 \mu) - \sin^2 \mu \frac{d^2 r}{d\theta^2}}{\left(\frac{dr}{d\theta}\right)^2} d\theta$$
 (2.8.6)

Equations (2.8.6) and (2.8.3) yield the following expression for the curvature radius:

<span id="page-46-5"></span><span id="page-46-3"></span>
$$\rho(\theta) = \frac{[r(\theta)]^2}{\sin\mu \left[ r(\theta)(2 - \sin^2\mu) - \sin^2\mu \frac{d^2r}{d\theta^2} \right]}$$
(2.8.7)

The curvature radius  $\rho(\theta)$  is represented as well in differential geometry (Korn & Korn, 1968) as

<span id="page-46-4"></span><span id="page-46-2"></span>
$$\rho(\theta) = \frac{\left[r(\theta)^2 + \left(\frac{dr}{d\theta}\right)^2\right]^{3/2}}{r(\theta)^2 + 2\left(\frac{dr}{d\theta}\right)^2 - r(\theta)\frac{d^2r}{d\theta^2}}$$
(2.8.8)

We may obtain (2.8.8) from (2.8.7) taking into account that

$$r(\theta)^2 + \left(\frac{dr}{d\theta}\right)^2 = r(\theta)^2 + \frac{r(\theta)^2}{\tan^2 \mu} = \frac{r(\theta)^2}{\sin^2 \mu}$$
 (2.8.9)

$$2\left(\frac{dr}{d\theta}\right)^2 = 2\frac{r(\theta)^2}{\tan^2 \mu} \tag{2.8.10}$$

#### <span id="page-47-9"></span><span id="page-47-8"></span><span id="page-47-5"></span><span id="page-47-1"></span><span id="page-47-0"></span>2.9 Conditions of Centrode Convexity

Equation (2.8.8) of curvature radius  $\rho$  yields the following condition of centrode convexity ( $\rho > 0$ ):

<span id="page-47-2"></span>
$$r(\phi)^2 + 2\left(\frac{dr}{d\phi}\right)^2 - r(\theta)\frac{d^2r}{d\phi^2} > 0$$
 (2.9.1)

We recall that  $\phi = \theta$  (see Fig. 2.3.1). Using equations of centrodes and inequality (2.9.1), we obtain the conditions for centrodes convexity.

Equation (2.4.2) and inequality (2.9.1) show that centrode 1 is convex by observation of the condition

<span id="page-47-6"></span><span id="page-47-3"></span>
$$1 + m_{12}(\phi_1) + m_{12}''(\phi_1) \ge 0 \tag{2.9.2}$$

Similarly, using Eqs. (2.4.4) and (2.4.5) for centrode 2 and inequality (2.9.1), we obtain conditions of centrode 2 convexity as

<span id="page-47-7"></span><span id="page-47-4"></span>
$$1 + m_{12}(\phi_1) + [m'_{12}(\phi_1)]^2 - m_{12}(\phi_1)m''_{12}(\phi_1) \ge 0$$
 (2.9.3)

Here.

$$m'_{12}(\phi_1) = \frac{d}{d\phi_1}(m_{12}(\phi_1)); \qquad m''_{12}(\phi_1) = \frac{d^2}{d^2\phi_1}(m_{12}(\phi_1))$$
 (2.9.4)

When the inequalities (2.9.2) and (2.9.3) turn into equalities, there is a centrode point where  $\rho = \infty$ .

Using the approach discussed here for the generation of function by noncircular gears, we obtain the following conditions of convexity of the centrodes of the driving and driven gears, respectively.

Let us consider now the case that the noncircular gears are designed for generation of the function z = f(u). Then we obtain

$$m_{12}(u) = \frac{k_1}{k_2 f'(u)} \tag{2.9.5}$$

where the relation between  $\phi_1$  and u is

$$\phi_1 = k_1(u - u_1) \tag{2.9.6}$$

Respectively, we obtain

$$m'_{12}(\phi_1) = \frac{d}{d\phi_1} (m_{12}(\phi_1)) = \frac{d}{du} (m_{12}(\phi_1)) \frac{du}{d\phi_1} = -\left(\frac{1}{k_2}\right) \frac{f''(u)}{[f'(u)]^2}$$
(2.9.7)

$$m_{12}''(\phi_1) = \left(\frac{1}{k_1 k_2}\right) \frac{2[f''(u)]^2 - f'(u)f'''(u)}{[f'(u)]^3}$$
(2.9.8)

Finally, the conditions of convexity of centrodes 1 and 2 are represented respectively as

$$k_1 k_2 [f'(u)]^3 + k_1^2 [f'(u)]^2 + 2[f''(u)]^2 - f'''(u)f'(u) \ge 0$$
 (2.9.9)

$$k_2[f'(u)]^3[k_1 + k_2f'(u)] + f'(u)f'''(u) - [f''(u)]^2 \ge 0$$
(2.9.10)

#### 3.1 Introduction and Terminology

**CENTRODES AND PITCH CURVES.** *Centrodes* (see Chapter 2) may be considered as frictional disks (circular or noncircular) that roll over each other in the process of meshing. The centrodes are provided with teeth, and such a mechanism (gear mechanism) transforms rotation by the meshing of teeth.

Figure 3.1.1 shows the centrodes (as mating circles) of a gear mechanism with circular gears. For the purpose of simplification of drawings, only two profiles of teeth are shown in Fig. 3.1.1. The instantaneous point of contact of the tooth profiles is shown in Fig. 3.1.1 as I.

Points  $M_i^{(\bar{1})}$  and  $M_i^{(2)}$  in Fig. 3.1.1 represent points of intersection of neighboring profiles with the centrodes of radii  $r_p^{(1)}$  and  $r_p^{(2)}$ . The distance p between two neighboring points  $M_i^{(j)}$  (j=1,2) is measured along the arc of the respective centrode and is determined as  $p=m\pi$ , where m is the module of the gears.

It will be shown here that even neighboring profiles may have different evolutes (for instance, see Fig. 3.1.3). There is an exemption with involute spur gears, wherein the evolutes of neighboring profiles are arcs of the same circles called *base circles* of radii  $r_b^{(i)}$  (i=1,2). Centrodes of radii  $r_p^{(i)}$  (i=1,2) are usually called *pitch circles*, but the preferable notation is centrodes.

**CONCEPT OF EVOLUTE AND INVOLUTE OF PLANAR CURVES.** The concept of evolute and involute of a planar curve has been developed in differential geometry.

We call *involute* the tooth profile obtained in the transverse section of the gear tooth. The profile might be represented by a curve or, in some cases, by a straight line. Figure 3.1.2 shows the tooth profile as a planar curve  $\sigma_1$  formed by points  $M_1, M_2, \dots, M_n$ . We may determine for each point  $M_i$  of  $\sigma_1$  the curvature center  $N_i$  of involute  $\sigma_1$  at point  $M_i$  of the involute. Straight lines  $\overline{M_i N_i}$  ( $i = 1, 2, \dots, n$ ) are the normals to the involute. Following the definition in differential geometry, we determine the evolute  $\sigma_2$  of curve  $\sigma_1$  as the locus of curvature centers of  $\sigma_1$  (Fig. 3.1.2). Thus, points  $N_i$  ( $i = 1, 2, \dots, n$ ) of normals  $M_i - N_i$  to  $\sigma_1$  form curve

 $N_1 - N_2 - \cdots - N_n$  (Fig. 3.1.2), which is called the *evolute*. Straight lines  $\overline{M_i N_i}$ , the normals to involute  $\sigma_1$ , are the tangents to the evolute (curve  $\sigma_2$ , Fig. 3.1.2).

We may also interpret evolute  $\sigma_2$  as the envelope to the family of normals  $M_i N_i$  to curve  $\sigma_1$ . Considering as given evolute  $\sigma_2$ , we may trace out curve  $\sigma_1$  by a point of a string as it unwinds from  $\sigma_2$ .

#### APPLICATION OF CONCEPT OF EVOLUTE AND INVOLUTE IN THE THEORY OF GEARING.

A transverse section of a single gear tooth provides two involute profiles and two evolutes (Fig. 3.1.3). The exemption of this rule is the so-called involute gearing, wherein the envelope to normals  $M_i - N_i$  and  $M_i^* - N_i^*$  to the tooth profiles  $\sigma_1$  and  $\sigma_1^*$  is the same circle, called the *base circle* (see Fig. 3.1.1).

Figure 3.1.3 shows in exaggerated style the tooth of an involute spur gear. Points  $M_1-M_2-\cdots-M_n$  form the involute profile of the left side of the tooth. Similarly, points  $M_1^*-M_2^*-\cdots-M_n^*$  form the right side of the tooth. Normals  $M_i-N_i$  ( $i=1,\cdots,n$ ) to the involute profile  $\sigma_1$  form a family of straight lines that are tangents to evolute  $\sigma_2$  (Fig. 3.1.3). Points  $N_i$  form evolute  $\sigma_2$  as  $N_1-N_2-\cdots-N_n$ . Respectively, normals  $M_i^*-N_i^*$  ( $i=1,\cdots,n$ ) to profile  $\sigma_1^*$  are tangents to evolute  $\sigma_2^*$ . Thus, points  $N_1^*-N_2^*-\cdots-N_n^*$  form envelope  $\sigma_2^*$ .

As mentioned previously, in the case of an involute spur gear the evolutes  $\sigma_2$  and  $\sigma_2^*$  for both involute profiles  $\sigma_1$  and  $\sigma_1^*$  are arcs of the same circle, the base circle. For the case of noncircular gears, profiles  $\sigma_1$  and  $\sigma_1^*$  of the tooth have different evolutes.

#### 3.2 Determination of Evolutes

In the process of generation of noncircular gears, centrode 1 of the tool (rack cutter, shaper) is rolling over centrode 2 of the noncircular gear being generated (Fig. 3.2.1). Point P is the common point of tangency of centrodes 1 and 2. We emphasize that the normal to the tooth profile and the common tangent  $\mathbf{t}$  to the centrode (1 or 2) forms a constant angle  $\alpha_c$  that is the profile angle of the tool.

The position vector  $r(\theta)$  of centrode 2 (of the noncircular gear) and the normal to the tooth profile form angle  $\lambda_i$  (i = l, r), wherein subindex i of  $\lambda_i$  indicates the normals to the left (i = l) and right (i = r) sides of profiles of the noncircular gear.

**34 Evolutes and Involutes**

It follows from the drawings that

<span id="page-51-1"></span>
$$\lambda_l = \mu + \alpha_c \tag{3.2.1}$$

<span id="page-51-2"></span>
$$\lambda_r = \pi + \mu - \alpha_c \tag{3.2.2}$$

where α*<sup>c</sup>* is the profile angle of the tool.

Figure [3.2.2](#page-52-0) shows polar curve σ1, the centrode of a noncircular gear. For the purpose of simplification of notation, we are not using the subindexes of notation of λ, µ, or*r*(θ), but the obtained equations for the evolutes may be applied for evolutes of left and right profiles.

The analytical determination of evolute σ<sup>2</sup> requires determination of *l* = *MC*, where *C* is the point of tangency of normal **N** with the evolute. Knowing parameter λ – see Eqs. [\(3.2.1\)](#page-51-1) and [\(3.2.2\)](#page-51-2) – and parameter *l* = |*MC*|, it becomes possible to determine the evolute of profiles.

Determination of parameter *l* = |*MC*| (Fig. [3.2.2\)](#page-52-0) requires application of the theory of envelope to the family of normals **N**. The illustration of derivations is performed by application of a linkage shown in Fig. [3.2.2](#page-52-0) with three movable links. Link 1 is provided with slider 2 and performs rotation about point *O*, simulating the centrode of the gear. Link 3 may perform rotation about point *M*, being the tangent to the evolute.

The velocity **v** of point *C* of the normal is considered as the sum of the following components: (i) **v***<sup>e</sup>* in rotation together with link 1 about *O*; (ii) velocity **v***<sup>r</sup>* in

<span id="page-52-0"></span>
$$\mathbf{v}_{c} = \mathbf{v}_{e} + \mathbf{v}_{r} + \mathbf{v}_{32} = \boldsymbol{\omega}^{(1)} \times (\mathbf{r} + \mathbf{l}) + \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} + \boldsymbol{\omega}^{(32)} \times \mathbf{l}$$
$$= \boldsymbol{\omega}^{(1)} \times \mathbf{r} + (\boldsymbol{\omega}^{(1)} + \boldsymbol{\omega}^{(32)}) \times \mathbf{l} + \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt}$$
(3.2.3)

Here:  $\boldsymbol{\omega}^{(1)} = -\frac{d\theta}{dt}\mathbf{k}$ ;  $\boldsymbol{\omega}^{(32)} = \frac{d\lambda}{dt}\mathbf{k}$ ;  $\mathbf{r} = r\cos\theta\mathbf{i} + r\sin\theta\mathbf{j}$ ;  $\mathbf{l} = l\cos(\theta + \lambda)\mathbf{i} + l\sin(\theta + \lambda)\mathbf{j}$ 

Taking into account that  $\frac{r(\theta)}{dr/d\theta} = \tan \mu$  [see Eq. (2.5.1)], we obtain  $\frac{dr}{dt} = r \cot \mu \frac{d\theta}{dt}$  and  $\frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} = -r \cot \mu \frac{d\theta}{dt} (\cos \theta \mathbf{i} + \sin \theta \mathbf{j})$ , wherein  $(\mathbf{i}, \mathbf{j}, \mathbf{k})$  are the unit vectors of coordinate axes (x, y, z) (Fig. 3.2.2).

Equations (3.2.4), (3.2.5), and (3.2.6) yield

$$l(\theta) = r(\theta) \frac{\sin(\lambda - \mu)}{\left(1 + \frac{d\lambda}{d\theta}\right)\sin\mu}$$
(3.2.7)

Equation (3.2.7) may be applied for the determination of evolute of profiles for planar gears with various geometries.

Taking into account Eq. (2.8.7) of curvature radius  $\rho$  for planar gears, we obtain after transformations the following expression for the determination of evolute:

$$l(\theta) = \rho(\theta) \sin \alpha_c \tag{3.2.8}$$

where  $\rho(\theta)$  is the curvature radius of the centrode. Figure 3.2.3 illustrates the evolutes  $\sigma_2$  and  $\sigma_2^*$  of an elliptical centrode at point M.

Using such an approach, for instance with an elliptical gear (Fig. [3.3.1\)](#page-51-0), we may represent the profiles of teeth 1 and 10 as profiles of teeth of circular gears with radii ρ*<sup>A</sup>* and ρ*B*, respectively. The radii ρ*<sup>A</sup>* and ρ*<sup>B</sup>* are the curvature radii ρ*<sup>A</sup>* and ρ*<sup>B</sup>* at respective points *A* and *B* of elliptical centrode for teeth 1 and 10 (Fig. [3.3.1\)](#page-51-0).

The idea of local representation of a noncircular gear is useful for an approximate solution of avoidance of undercutting of noncircular gears (see Section [4.3.2.2\)](#page-64-2).

The conditions of force transmission by noncircular gears are varied in the process of motion due to variation of orientation of profile normal.

The pressure angle is varied in the process of meshing due to change of angle µ (due to the change of orientation of the tangent to the centrodes).

#### **4.2.1 Ellipse Parameters**

Figure [4.2.1](#page-58-2) shows (i) the major and minor axes of an ellipse denoted as 2*a* and 2*b*, (ii) focuses *F* and *F*<sup>∗</sup> of distance 2*c* < 2*a*, and (iii) chordal distance 2*p*. The main feature of the ellipse is that two position vectors |*F M*| = *r*<sup>1</sup> and |*F*<sup>∗</sup>*M*| = *r* <sup>∗</sup> <sup>1</sup> are related as

<span id="page-57-4"></span>
$$r_1 + r_1^* = 2a (4.2.1)$$

It follows from Eq. [\(4.2.1\)](#page-57-4) that an ellipse may be traced out by point *M* of thread *F*<sup>∗</sup> − *M* − *F* (Fig. [4.2.1\)](#page-58-2) by variation of the location of point *M* on the ellipse to be generated.

Using Eq. [\(4.2.1\)](#page-57-4) and drawings of Figs. [4.2.2\(](#page-58-3)a) and [4.2.2\(](#page-58-3)b), it is easy to verify that

$$b = \sqrt{a^2 - c^2} = a\sqrt{1 - e^2} \tag{4.2.2}$$

$$p = a(1 - e^2) (4.2.3)$$

The polar equation of an ellipse represents ellipse point *Mi*(*i* = 1, 2) by the position vector *r*1(θ1) that is drawn from the respective focus of the ellipse. Henceforth, we will consider two polar equations of an ellipse that correspond to the drawings of Fig. [4.2.3\(](#page-59-0)a), where the polar axis is *F A*<sup>1</sup> and the position vector is *F M*<sup>1</sup> = *r*1(θ1), and Fig. [4.2.3\(](#page-59-0)b), where the polar axis is *F*<sup>∗</sup>*A*<sup>2</sup> and the position vector is *F*<sup>∗</sup>*M*<sup>2</sup> = *r*1(θ1). Angle θ<sup>1</sup> in Figs.

$$|\overline{DM_1}| = r_1(\theta_1)\sin\theta_1\tag{4.2.6}$$

$$|\overline{F^*M_1}| = r_1^*(\theta_1) = 2a - r_1(\theta_1)$$
 (4.2.7)

as follows from Eq. [\(4.2.1\)](#page-57-4). Equations from [\(4.2.4\)](#page-59-2) to [\(4.2.7\)](#page-59-3), after some transformations, yield

#### **4.3 External Elliptical Gear Drives**

The term "external" means that the driving and driven centrodes, σ<sup>1</sup> and σ2, are in *external meshing*. Internal gear drives are considered in Chapter [7,](#page-132-2) wherein the driven centrode σ<sup>2</sup> is in internal meshing with driving centrode σ1.

The following types of centrodes for external gear drives are considered: (i) conventional elliptical centrodes (Sections [4.3.2](#page-62-2) and [4.3.3\)](#page-69-2), (ii) modified elliptical centrodes (Section [4.3.4\)](#page-70-2), (iii) oval centrodes (Section [4.3.5\)](#page-74-2), and (iv) centrodes with lobes (Section [4.3.6\)](#page-77-2).

A conventional elliptical centrode is obtained from a conventional ellipse represented by polar equation [\(4.2.9\)](#page-59-6), wherein the polar axis is *F A*<sup>1</sup> and the pole is the focus *F* of the ellipse (Fig. [4.2.3\(](#page-59-0)a)), or by polar equation [\(4.2.14\)](#page-60-3), wherein the polar axis is *F*<sup>∗</sup>*A*<sup>2</sup> and the pole is the focus *F*<sup>∗</sup> of the ellipse (Fig. [4.2.3\(](#page-59-0)b)).

A modified elliptical centrode is obtained from a conventional ellipse, wherein the respective position vectors of the ellipse and modified centrode have the same magnitude but different polar angles (see Section [4.3.4\)](#page-70-2). An oval centrode is obtained from a conventional ellipse as well by the modification described previously (Section [4.3.5\)](#page-74-2). A gear or centrode with lobes is formed by arcs of a modified ellipse (Section [4.3.6\)](#page-77-2).

Design of gear drives with elliptical centrodes (conventional or modified) will cover the case wherein the pinion performs *n* revolutions for one revolution of the driven gear. The centrodes of the gear drives might be designed with closed or nonclosed centrodes.

#### **4.3.1 Basic Equations**

The basic equations applied for the design of external elliptical gear drives are as follows:

**Step 1.** The driving centrode is represented in polar form by

$$r_1(\phi_1), \qquad 0 \le \phi_1 \le 2\pi n \tag{4.3.1}$$

<span id="page-61-5"></span><span id="page-61-4"></span>if the pinion performs n revolutions for one revolution of the driven centrode;  $\phi_1$  is the angle of rotation of the pinion that is measured opposite to parameter  $\theta_1$ .

**Step 2.** The derivative function  $m_{21}(\phi_1)$  is represented by

<span id="page-61-0"></span>
$$m_{21}(\phi_1) = \frac{d\phi_2}{d\phi_1} = \frac{r_1(\phi_1)}{r_2(\phi_1)} = \frac{r_1(\phi_1)}{E - r_1(\phi_1)}$$
 (4.3.2)

where  $E = r_1(\phi_1) + r_2(\phi_1)$  is the center distance. Similarly, derivative function  $m_{12}(\phi_1)$  is represented by

<span id="page-61-1"></span>
$$m_{12}(\phi_1) = \frac{d\phi_1}{d\phi_2} = \frac{r_2(\phi_1)}{r_1(\phi_1)} = \frac{E - r_1(\phi_1)}{r_1(\phi_1)}$$
 (4.3.3)

The meaning of Eqs. (4.3.2) and (4.3.3) is that centrodes  $\sigma_1$  and  $\sigma_2$  roll over each other. Function  $m_{21}(\phi_1)$  must be a periodic one to obtain a closed form curve (see Section 2.6).

**Step 3.** Determination of center distance E. It follows from Eqs. (4.3.2) that

<span id="page-61-2"></span>
$$\phi_2(\phi_1) = \frac{2\pi}{n} = \int_0^{2\pi} m_{21}(\phi_1) d\phi_1 = \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{r_1(\phi_1)}{E - r_1(\phi_1)} d\phi_1$$
 (4.3.4)

where n is an integer number and represents the number of revolutions of the driving centrode for one revolution of the driven centrode. The sought-for center distance is determined as the solution of Eq. (4.3.4) for E = E(a, e, n), where 2a is the magnitude of the major axis of the elliptical centrode  $\sigma_1$  and e is the eccentricity.

It will be proven that

$$E = E(a, e, n) \tag{4.3.5}$$

is the same for elliptical, modified elliptical, or oval gear drives as well as for gears with lobes. Determination of *E* for gear drives mentioned here is obtained analytically by application of Eq. (2.6.5) provided by Dwight (Dwight, 1961).

**Step 4.** Determination of centrode  $\sigma_2$ . Centrode  $\sigma_2$  is determined by the equations

<span id="page-61-3"></span>
$$r_2(\phi_1) = E - r_1(\phi_1) \tag{4.3.6}$$

$$\phi_2(\phi_1) = \int_0^{\phi_1} m_{21}(\phi_1) d\phi_1 \tag{4.3.7}$$

Equation (4.3.7) represents the transmission function  $\phi_2(\phi_1)$  that may be obtained numerically, or analytically by using Eq. (2.6.6) provided by Dwight (Dwight, 1961).

#### **4.3.2.1 Centrodes and Transmission Function**

A conventional elliptical gear drive is formed by two elliptical gears that may be assembled as shown in Figs. [4.3.1\(](#page-58-4)a) or [4.3.1\(](#page-58-4)b). Figure [4.3.1\(](#page-58-4)a) shows a gear drive wherein center *O*<sup>1</sup> of rotation of centrode σ<sup>1</sup> coincides with the lower focus *F* of ellipse 1. On the other side, Figure [4.3.1\(](#page-58-4)b) shows a gear drive wherein center *O*<sup>1</sup> of rotation of centrode σ<sup>1</sup> coincides with the upper focus *F*<sup>∗</sup> of ellipse 1 (see Section [4.2.2\)](#page-58-5). The polar axes *F A*<sup>1</sup> and *F*<sup>∗</sup>*A*<sup>2</sup> (Fig. [4.2.3\)](#page-59-0) are directed along center distance *O*1*O*<sup>2</sup> (Fig. [4.3.1\)](#page-58-4).

Figure [4.3.2](#page-58-6) shows an elliptical centrode that performs rotation around center *O*<sup>1</sup> (it is the lower focus *F* of ellipse 1). We recall that the instantaneous point *I* of tangency of centrode 1 and centrode 2 (centrode 2 is not shown) moves along center distance *O*1*O*<sup>2</sup> (Fig. [4.3.2\)](#page-58-6) in the process of motion. The center distance is *E* = 2*a*, where 2*a* is the major axis of mating elliptical centrodes 1 and 2.

Centrode σ<sup>1</sup> (Figs. [4.3.1\(](#page-58-4)a) and [4.3.2\)](#page-58-6) is represented by

<span id="page-62-3"></span>

Figure 4.3.2. For derivation of transmission function  $\phi_2(\phi_1)$  of elliptical gears.

The derivative function  $m_{12}(\phi_1)$  is determined as

$$m_{12}(\phi_1) = \frac{d\phi_1}{d\phi_2} = \frac{r_2(\phi_1)}{r_1(\phi_1)} = \frac{E - r_1(\phi_1)}{r_1(\phi_1)}$$
 (4.3.9)

where  $r_2(\phi_1)$  determines the magnitude  $r_2(\phi_1) = \overline{O_2I}$  (Fig. 4.3.2). Taking into account Eq. (4.3.8), E = 2a, and  $p = a(1 - e^2)$ , we obtain

$$m_{12}(\phi_1) = \frac{1 + e^2 - 2e\cos\phi_1}{1 - e^2}$$
 (4.3.10)

The sought-for transmission function may then be represented as

$$\phi_2(\phi_1) = \int_0^{\phi_1} \frac{d\phi_1}{m_{12}(\phi_1)} = (1 - e^2) \int_0^{\phi_1} \frac{d\phi_1}{1 + e^2 - 2e\cos\phi_1}$$
(4.3.11)

We obtain transmission function  $\phi_2(\phi_1)$  as a closed form solution as follows (Dwight, 1961):

<span id="page-63-1"></span><span id="page-63-0"></span>
$$\tan\frac{\phi_2}{2} = \frac{1+e}{1-e}\tan\frac{\phi_1}{2} \tag{4.3.12}$$

The transmission function represented in Eq. (4.3.12) corresponds to the assembly positions of centrodes as shown in Fig. 4.3.1(a). For assembly as shown in Fig. 4.3.1(b), we obtain

<span id="page-63-3"></span><span id="page-63-2"></span>
$$\tan\frac{\phi_2}{2} = \frac{1-e}{1+e}\tan\frac{\phi_1}{2} \tag{4.3.13}$$

#### <span id="page-64-3"></span><span id="page-64-2"></span>**4.3.2.2 Influence of Ellipse Parameters and Design Recommendations**

**VARIATION OF PRESSURE ANGLE** *α***12.** The pressure angle α<sup>12</sup> of noncircular gears has been determined in Section [3.4](#page-54-2) by Eqs. [\(3.4.1\)](#page-56-0) and [\(3.4.2\)](#page-56-1). It was shown by Fig. [3.4.2](#page-52-1) that the sign of α<sup>12</sup> may be changed in the process of transformation of motions. Figures [4.3.4](#page-65-0) and [4.3.5](#page-65-1) in addition to Fig. [3.4.2](#page-52-1) show the change of magnitude of α<sup>12</sup> for elliptical gears with various values of eccentricity of the ellipse. It results from investigation of α<sup>12</sup> that it is necessary to limit the eccentricity of the ellipse to keep α<sup>12</sup> in the range −50◦ ≤ α<sup>12</sup> ≤ 50◦. Function α12*max*(*e*) (Fig. [4.3.6\)](#page-66-0) shows the influence of ellipse eccentricity. Reduction of magnitude of α<sup>12</sup> may be obtained by design of gear drives with more than one stage.

**AVOIDANCE OF UNDERCUTTING.** The approach is based on the idea of local representation of profiles of noncircular gears by profiles of a set of circular gears (see Section [3.3](#page-53-6) and Fig. [3.3.1\)](#page-51-0). The computational procedure is as follows:

(i) We determine the minimal radius ρ*min* of curvature of an elliptical centrode at point *A* in Fig. [4.3.7](#page-66-1) as

$$\rho_{min} = \frac{b^2}{a} = a(1 - e^2) \tag{4.3.16}$$

<span id="page-65-0"></span>Figure 4.3.4. Variation of pressure angle α<sup>12</sup> for location of rotation center in lower ellipse focus.

(ii) Undercutting of involute gear of radius *R* = ρ*min* is avoided, if the tooth number *N* is *N* > *N*<sup>∗</sup>, where

$$N^* = \frac{2}{\sin^2 \alpha_c} \tag{4.3.17}$$

where α*<sup>c</sup>* is the profile angle of the rack cutter.

(iii) Consider that the module of the rack cutter is *m*. Then we obtain the pitch radius of the substituting involute gear as ρ*<sup>A</sup>* = (*mN*)/2. Undercutting is avoided if

$$\frac{mN^*}{2} \le \rho_{min} = a(1 - e^2) \tag{4.3.18}$$

The developed approach may be applied for other types of noncircular gears, but it needs determination of the minimal curvature radius of the centrode of the gear.

**APPLICATION OF ODD TOOTH NUMBER OF ELLIPTICAL GEARS.** While choosing the linear dimensions of elliptical gears, it is required that the length *L* of the centrode of an elliptical gear will be equal to

$$L = \pi mN \tag{4.3.20}$$

where *m* is the module of the tool and *N* the number of teeth of the elliptical gear.

Compensation of the error *xi* of the installment of the tool requires (i) to choose an odd number of teeth for both elliptical gears 1 and 2, and (ii) make a turn of 180◦ about *O*1*O*<sup>2</sup> of one of the gears in the assembly. This statement is based on the following considerations:

(i) It is assumed that the same hob (rack cutter) is applied for generation of the mating elliptical gears and they have the same number of teeth.

- <span id="page-68-2"></span><span id="page-68-1"></span>(ii) Figure 4.3.8(a) shows the error  $\Delta x_i$  of installment of the rack cutter with respect to line  $\overline{O_i A}$ . The center distance of the gears after their assembly will coincide with  $\overline{O_i A}$ .
- (iii) Figure 4.3.8(b) shows the location of the tooth of the rack cutter after its displacement a distance

$$L^* = \frac{\pi mN}{2} {(4.3.21)}$$

where N is the odd number of teeth of the elliptical gear. Here  $L^*$  is measured from the initial position of the rack cutter shown in Fig. 4.3.8(a). We recall that  $\Delta x_i$  denotes the displacement of the axis of symmetry of the space of the rack cutter (Fig. 4.3.8(a)) and  $\Delta x_i^*$  denotes the displacement of the tooth of the rack cutter (Fig. 4.3.8(b)) after a rack cutter translation of magnitude  $L^*$ .

The compensation of the error of installment of the rack cutter will be achieved after one of the mating gears is turned on 180° around  $\overline{O_1 O_2}$ , as shown in Fig. 4.3.8(c).

**TOOTH NUMBER OF ELLIPTICAL GEARS.** The number of teeth that might be provided for an elliptical gear is determined by the parameters of the ellipse (dimensions of major and minor axes a and b) and the module m. The first step of the computational procedure is the determination of the length of the elliptical centrode considering the ellipse as the pitch curve.

To determine the length of the elliptical centrode, it is preferable to represent the centrode in parametric form as

$$x = a\sin\psi, \qquad y = b\cos\psi \tag{4.3.22}$$

The arc ds of the ellipse is represented as

$$ds = \sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2} = \sqrt{a^2 \cos^2 \psi + b^2 \sin^2 \psi} d\psi = a\sqrt{1 - e^2 \sin^2 \psi} d\psi \qquad (4.3.23)$$

The length of an arc of the centrode is determined by

$$s = a \int_0^{\psi} \sqrt{1 - e^2 \sin^2 \psi} \, d\psi, \qquad e = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 - b^2}}{a} = \frac{c}{a}$$
 (4.3.24)

The integral

$$\int_{0}^{\psi} \sqrt{1 - e^2 \sin^2 \psi} \, d\psi \tag{4.3.25}$$

has found a broad application in astronomy as the elliptic integral of second kind and may be calculated numerically.

The number of teeth of an elliptical gear is determined by

<span id="page-68-0"></span>
$$N = \frac{4a}{m\pi} \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \sqrt{1 - e^2 \sin^2 \psi} \, d\psi \tag{4.3.26}$$

<span id="page-69-1"></span><span id="page-69-0"></span>where  $m\pi$  is the distance between the neighboring teeth measured along the centrode. Considering that module m is of a standard value, we may obtain an integer number N of teeth by taking a proper magnitude for a. Considering that the elliptical centrode is represented by

$$r(\theta) = \frac{a(1 - e^2)}{1 + e\cos\theta}$$
 (4.3.27)

we obtain the following relation between parameters  $\psi$  and  $\theta$ :

$$\cos \theta = \frac{\sin \psi - e}{1 - e \sin \psi} \tag{4.3.28}$$

#### <span id="page-69-2"></span>4.3.3 Gear Drive with Elliptical Pinion and Conjugated Gear

The difference with the gear drive of previous section is that pinion  $\sigma_1$  performs not one but n revolutions for one revolution of gear  $\sigma_2$ . To obtain  $\sigma_2$  as a closed-form curve, the center distance E must satisfy the equation derived in Section 2.6.

The computational procedure is based on the following equations:

(1) Centrode  $\sigma_1$  is determined as

$$r_1(\phi_1) = \frac{a(1 - e^2)}{1 - e\cos\phi_1} \tag{4.3.29}$$

(2) Center distance E is determined as (see Problem 2.6.1 in Section 2.6)

$$E = a \left[ 1 + \sqrt{1 + (n^2 - 1)(1 - e^2)} \right]$$
 (4.3.30)

It may be noticed that for n = 1, E = 2a, as considered for conventional elliptical gear drives.

(3) The derivative function is

$$m_{21}(\phi_1) = \frac{r_1(\phi_1)}{E - r_1(\phi_1)} = \left(\frac{1}{n}\right) \frac{1 - e^2}{1 - 2e\cos\phi_1 + e^2}$$
(4.3.31)

(4) Centrode  $\sigma_2$  is represented by equations

$$r_2(\phi_1) = E - r_1(\phi_1) \tag{4.3.32}$$

$$\phi_2(\phi_1) = \int_0^{\phi_1} m_{21}(\phi_1) d\phi_1 \tag{4.3.33}$$

where  $\phi_2(\phi_1)$  is the transmission function. After derivations, we obtain

$$\tan\frac{n\phi_2}{2} = \frac{1+e}{1-e}\tan\frac{\phi_1}{2} \tag{4.3.34}$$

We emphasize that the centrode of gear 1 is a conventional ellipse, but the centrode of gear 2 for  $n \neq 1$  is a transformed ellipse.

Figures 4.3.9(a) and 4.3.9(b) illustrate the centrodes of two gear drives in which centrode  $\sigma_1$  is represented as a conventional ellipse that performs two and three revolutions, respectively, for one revolution of centrode  $\sigma_2$ .

#### <span id="page-70-5"></span><span id="page-70-3"></span><span id="page-70-2"></span>**4.3.4 External Gear Drive with Modified Elliptical Gears**

Modification of the centrodes enables obtaining an asymmetric derivative function *m*21(φ1) = ω(2)/ω(1) of the gear ratio of the gear drive (Fig. [4.3.10\)](#page-70-4). The interval *I*: 0 ≤ φ<sup>1</sup> ≤ π/*mI* (π/*mI* < π) corresponds to the free-running part of the cycle (faster), and the interval *I I*: π/*mI* ≤ φ<sup>1</sup> ≤ 2π corresponds to the working part of the cycle (slower). Application of a gear drive with gears having such centrodes is useful for tandem design with a linkage (see Section [10.6.2\)](#page-191-2) for variation of the output speed.

#### **4.3.4.1 Modification of the Ellipse**

The modified elliptical centrode of the driving gear 1 is formed by two branches, *I* and *I I* (Fig. [4.3.11\)](#page-71-0). The transformation of the conventional elliptical centrode into two modified branches is performed with observation of the following relations:

- (ii) Similarly, for the other branch of the centrode (Fig. 4.3.11(b)) we have  $|\overline{O_1B_2}| = |\overline{O_1B_1}|$  but the polar angle for position vector  $\overline{O_1B_2}$  is changed from  $2\pi \phi_1$  to  $(2\pi \phi_1)/m_{II}$ . The coefficients of modification  $m_I$  and  $m_{II}$  are related by

<span id="page-72-3"></span>
$$m_{II} = \frac{m_I}{2m_I - 1} \tag{4.3.35}$$

This yields that the two branches (Figs. 4.3.11(a) and 4.3.11(b)) have a common point at  $\phi_1 = \pi/m_I$ .

Modified centrode  $\sigma_1$  is formed by curves  $\sigma_1^{(I)}$  and  $\sigma_1^{(II)}$  (Fig. 4.3.11(c)) that are in tangency at their common point.

#### **4.3.4.2** Derivation of Modified Centrode $\sigma_1$

The polar equation of a conventional ellipse is represented as

$$r_1(\phi_1) = \frac{p}{1 - e\cos\phi_1}, \qquad 0 \le \phi_1 \le 2\pi$$
 (4.3.36)

The two branches of the modified ellipse are represented with

$$r_1^{(I)}(\phi_1) = \frac{p}{1 - e\cos(m_I\phi_1)}, \qquad 0 \le \phi_1 \le \frac{\pi}{m_I}$$
 (4.3.37)

$$r_1^{(II)}(\phi_1) = \frac{p}{1 - e\cos(m_{II}(2\pi - \phi_1))}, \qquad \frac{\pi}{m_I} \le \phi_1 \le 2\pi$$
 (4.3.38)

Here,  $p = a(1 - e^2)$ .

# <span id="page-72-4"></span>**4.3.4.3** Derivative Functions $m_{21}^{(I)}(\phi_1)$ and $m_{21}^{(II)}(\phi_1)$

The derivation is based on the following relations:

$$m_{21}(\phi_1) = \frac{\omega^{(2)}}{\omega^{(1)}} = \frac{r_1(\phi_1)}{r_2(\phi_1)} = \frac{r_1(\phi_1)}{E - r_1(\phi_1)}$$
 (4.3.39)

We then obtain

$$m_{21}^{(I)}(\phi_1) = \frac{p}{E - p - Ee\cos(m_I\phi_1)}, \qquad 0 \le \phi_1 \le \frac{\pi}{m_I}$$
 (4.3.40)

$$m_{21}^{(II)}(\phi_1) = \frac{p}{E - p - Ee\cos(m_{II}(2\pi - \phi_1))}, \qquad \frac{\pi}{m_I} \le \phi_1 \le 2\pi$$
 (4.3.41)

#### 4.3.4.4 Relation between Rotations of Gears 1 and 2

Rotations of gear 1 and 2 are related by

<span id="page-72-2"></span>
$$2\pi = n \left[ \int_0^{\pi/m_I} m_{21}^{(I)}(\phi_1) d\phi_1 + \int_{\pi/m_I}^{2\pi} m_{21}^{(II)}(\phi_1) d\phi_1 \right]$$
(4.3.42)

<span id="page-73-4"></span><span id="page-73-1"></span><span id="page-73-0"></span>The meaning of Eq. (4.3.42) is that pinion 1 (centrode  $\sigma_1$ ) will perform n revolutions for one revolution of gear 2 (centrode  $\sigma_2$ ).

The following derivations are based on the change of variables:

$$m_I \phi_1 = x, \qquad d\phi_1 = \frac{dx}{m_I}$$
 (4.3.43)

$$m_{II}(2\pi - \phi_1) = y, \qquad d\phi_1 = -\frac{dy}{m_{II}}$$
 (4.3.44)

Then, Eq. (4.3.42) may be represented as

<span id="page-73-2"></span>
$$\frac{2\pi}{n} = \left(\frac{p}{E - p}\right) \left[ \left(\frac{1}{m_I}\right) \int_0^{\pi} \frac{dx}{1 - q\cos x} + \left(\frac{1}{m_{II}}\right) \int_0^{\pi} \frac{dy}{1 - \mu\cos y} \right]$$
(4.3.45)

where  $q = \mu = \frac{Ee}{E - p}$ .

From the tables of integrals provided by Dwight (Dwight, 1961) (see Eq. (2.6.5)), we obtain

$$\int_0^{\pi} \frac{dx}{1 - q \cos x} = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{1 - q^2}}, \qquad \int_0^{\pi} \frac{dy}{1 - \mu \cos y} = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{1 - \mu^2}}$$
(4.3.46)

It follows as well from (4.3.35) that

$$\frac{1}{m_I} + \frac{1}{m_{II}} = 2 \tag{4.3.47}$$

The solution of Eq. (4.3.45) for E = E(a, e, n) yields the same equation for the center distance as the one obtained for a gear drive with conventional elliptical gears:

<span id="page-73-3"></span>
$$E = a[1 + \sqrt{1 + (n^2 - 1)(1 - e^2)}]$$
 (4.3.48)

#### **4.3.4.5** Derivation of Centrode $\sigma_2$

The branches of centrode  $\sigma_2$  are represented by

$$r_2^{(I)}(\phi_1) = E - r_1^{(I)}(\phi_1)$$

$$\phi_2^{(I)}(\phi_1) = \int_0^{\phi_1} m_{21}^{(I)}(\phi_1) d\phi_1, \qquad 0 \le \phi_1 \le \frac{\pi}{m_I}$$
(4.3.49)

$$r_2^{(II)}(\phi_1) = E - r_1^{(II)}(\phi_1)$$

$$\phi_2^{(II)}(\phi_1) = \int_0^{\phi_1} m_{21}^{(II)}(\phi_1) d\phi_1, \qquad \frac{\pi}{m_I} \le \phi_1 \le 2\pi$$
 (4.3.50)

The transmission functions  $\phi_2^{(i)}(\phi_1)$ , (i = I, II), may be obtained by numerical integration or analytically by using Eq. (2.6.6) (Dwight, 1961) for a function

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{a \pm b \cos x}$$

An oval centrode is obtained by transformation of a conventional ellipse (see Section [4.3.4\)](#page-70-2) based on application of a parameter of modification *mI* as an integer *mI* = 2. Such oval gears with *mI* = 2 and *n* = 1 have found application in the past in flow meters for measuring the discharge of liquids (Fig. [4.3.15\)](#page-76-1).

The centrode of an oval gear is represented by

The term *lobe* used in technical literature has been adapted from anatomy to emphasize that the noncircular gear has several parts. An example of a noncircular gear that has three lobes is shown in Fig. [4.3.17.](#page-78-0)

<span id="page-78-1"></span><span id="page-78-0"></span>![](_page_78_Picture_2.jpeg)

Figure 4.3.17. Illustration of a noncircular gear with three lobes.

From such a point of view, an oval gear may be also considered as a noncircular gear with two lobes. The noncircular gears with lobes that are considered in this section have three or more lobes. We consider the profiles of lobes obtained by modification of ellipses (see ellipse modification in Section 4.3.4).

The driving and driven pinion and gear designed by ellipse modification are in a mixed external-internal meshing. There is a possibility to generate the lobes as gears by application of a shaper with a small number of teeth as done for internal noncircular gears.

This section covers design of noncircular gears with lobes based on the application of conjugated centrodes. Using derivations similar to those applied for oval centrodes, we obtain the following generalized system of equations for the design of noncircular gears with lobes:

$$r_1(\phi_1) = \frac{p}{1 - e\cos m_1\phi_1} = \frac{a(1 - e^2)}{1 - e\cos m_1\phi_1}$$
(4.3.63)

$$E = a \left[ 1 + \sqrt{1 + (n^2 - 1)(1 - e^2)} \right]$$
 (4.3.64)

$$r_2(\phi_1) = E - r_1(\phi_1) \tag{4.3.65}$$

$$\tan\frac{m_2\phi_2}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{1 + (n^2 - 1)(1 - e^2)} + e}{n(1 - e)} \tan\frac{m_1\phi_1}{2}$$
(4.3.66)

Here,  $m_1$  and  $m_2$  are the number of lobes of gear 1 and gear 2, respectively, and  $n = \frac{m_2}{m_1}$  is the ratio of related revolutions of gears 1 and 2.

Figure 4.3.18 shows examples of centrodes of noncircular gears with lobes for (a) n = 1 and  $m_1 = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ ; (b) n = 2 and  $m_1 = \{1, 2, 3\}$ ; (c) n = 3 and  $m_1 = \{1, 2\}$ . For all cases represented, the ellipse eccentricity e = 0.6.

# <span id="page-80-5"></span><span id="page-80-1"></span><span id="page-80-0"></span>**4.3.6.1** Design of Gear Drives with Different Number of Lobes for Pinion and Gear

Let us consider that the pinion is formed by three lobes and the gear is formed by four lobes. The procedure of design of such gear drive is as follows:

#### Step 1. Polar Equation of Pinion 1.

The equation is based on transformation of a conventional ellipse (see Section 4.3.2) and is represented as

<span id="page-80-3"></span>
$$r_1(\phi_1) = \frac{p}{1 - e\cos 3\phi_1}, \qquad p = a(1 - e^2), \qquad 0 \le \phi_1 \le 2\pi$$
 (4.3.67)

In comparison with an oval gear, the coefficient of modification is 3 but not 2. The coefficient of modification affects the magnitude of the polar angle of the radius vector, and therefore the shape of the lobe differs substantially from the shape of the ellipse and oval gear. The profiles of all three lobes of the pinion are identical.

The following derivations are directed toward determination of the center distance E between the pinion 1 and gear 2, and derivation of the equation of the gear centrode that is formed by four lobes. The applied procedure is represented as a sequence of steps.

#### **Step 2. Determination of Derivative Function** $m_{21}(\phi_1)$ **.**

Function  $m_{21}(\phi_1)$  is determined by application of

<span id="page-80-2"></span>
$$m_{21}(\phi_1) = \frac{d\phi_2}{d\phi_1} = \frac{r_1(\phi_1)}{r_2(\phi_2)} = \frac{r_1(\phi_1)}{E - r_1(\phi_1)}$$
 (4.3.68)

where  $r_2(\phi_1)$  represents the radius vector of the gear centrode. Observation of Eq. (4.3.68) guarantees that the pinion-gear centrodes roll over each other because the relative velocity is equal to zero.

Equations (4.3.67) and (4.3.68) yield the following expression of  $m_{21}(\phi_1)$ :

$$m_{21}(\phi_1) = \frac{p}{E - p - Ee \cos 3\phi_1} = \left(\frac{p}{E - p}\right) \left(\frac{1}{1 - q \cos 3\phi_1}\right), \qquad q = \frac{Ee}{E - p}$$
(4.3.69)

## Step 3. Determination of Relation between Revolutions of Pinion and Gear.

We consider in our example that the pinion and gear are provided with three and four lobes, respectively, and therefore the pinion performs four revolutions for three revolutions of the gear. This yields

<span id="page-80-4"></span>
$$2\pi = n \int_0^{2\pi} m_{21}(\phi_1) d\phi_1 = n \left(\frac{p}{E-p}\right) \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{d(3\phi_1)}{1 - q\cos(3\phi_1)}, \quad n = \frac{4}{3}$$

$$3\phi_1 = x, \qquad dx = \frac{d\phi_1}{3} \tag{4.3.71}$$

and the result of the following integral provided by Dwight (Dwight, 1961):

$$\int_0^\pi \frac{dx}{1 - q\cos x} = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{1 - q^2}} \tag{4.3.72}$$

Finally, we obtain the function

Equation (4.3.74) represents an extension of the previous formulation for determination of E for the case when n is not an integer number but a ratio of gear-pinion lobes that differs from an integer number.

Transmission function  $\phi_2(\phi_1)$  may be determined analytically, using Eq. (2.6.6) provided by Dwight (Dwight, 1961), or numerically, by integration of Eq. (4.3.76).

Figure 4.3.19 represents several examples of gear drives for different values of the eccentricity wherein the pinion has three lobes and the gear has four lobes.

#### 4.4 Transmission Function of Elliptical Gears as Curve of Second Order

Transmission function  $\phi_2(\phi_1)$  of elliptical gears has been represented in closed form by Eq. (4.3.12) (see as well Eq. (4.3.13)). Our goal is to prove that  $\phi_2(\phi_1)$  for a gear drive with identical ellipses is a curve of second order, particularly, a hyperbola. The proof is based on the following procedure:

**Step 1.** It is known from analytical geometry that curve  $\sigma$  of second order may be represented in coordinate system S(x, y) by an equation of the following structure (Korn & Korn, 1968):

<span id="page-82-3"></span>
$$a_{11}x^2 + 2a_{12}xy + a_{22}y^2 + 2a_{13}x + 2a_{23}y + a_{33} = 0 (4.4.1)$$

Curve  $\sigma$  may be determined by choosing five points, but any four of these five points should not belong to a straight line.

**Step 2.** The procedure is applied for transmission function  $\phi_2(\phi_1)$  determined by Eq. (4.3.12). The chosen five points belong to branches I and II and are represented by Fig. 4.4.1 as the set of points  $M_i$  ( $i = 1, \dots, 5$ ). Thus,

$$M_1\left(-\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2}},0\right), \quad M_2\left(\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2}},0\right), \quad M_3\left(-\frac{\pi}{2\sqrt{2}},y_3\right), \quad M_4\left(\frac{\pi}{2\sqrt{2}},y_4\right), \quad M_5\left(0,y_5\right)$$

$$(4.4.2)$$

Here,  $y_4 = y_3$  because branches *I* and *II* are symmetrical.

Points  $M_i$  ( $i=1,\dots,5$ ) must belong to the sought-for curve  $\sigma$  (of second order), and this is stated as observation of a system of five linear equations.

<span id="page-83-8"></span><span id="page-83-7"></span><span id="page-83-1"></span><span id="page-83-0"></span>The derivation of five linear equations is based on Eq. (4.4.1). Thus, we have

<span id="page-83-3"></span>
$$a_{11}x_i^2 + 2a_{12}x_iy_i + a_{22}y_i^2 + 2a_{13}x_i + 2a_{23}y_i + a_{33} = 0$$
 (i = 1, ..., 5) (4.4.3)

The unknowns in Eq. (4.4.3) are the coefficients  $a_{k\ell}$  (k = 1, 2, 3;  $\ell = 1, 2, 3$ ).

**Step 3.** The solutions of Eq. (4.4.3) for  $a_{k\ell}$  yield

$$a_{11} = -\frac{2}{\pi^2} a_{33},$$

$$a_{22} = \frac{\frac{3}{2} y_5 - 2y_3}{2 y_3 y_5 (y_5 - y_3)} a_{33},$$

$$a_{23} = -\frac{\frac{3}{2} y_5^2 - 2y_3^2}{4 y_3 y_5 (y_5 - y_3)} a_{33},$$

$$a_{12} = a_{13} = 0$$

$$(4.4.4)$$

<span id="page-83-4"></span>**Step 4.** We consider now that a point with coordinates (x, y) belongs to the sought-for curve  $\sigma$  of second order. We may then represent  $\sigma$  by using Eq. (4.4.1) and coefficients (4.4.4) as follows

<span id="page-83-5"></span>
$$\frac{2}{\pi^2}x^2 - \frac{\frac{3}{2}y_5 - 2y_3}{2y_3y_5(y_5 - y_3)}y^2 + \frac{\frac{3}{2}y_5^2 - 2y_3^2}{2y_3y_5(y_5 - y_3)}y = 1$$
 (4.4.5)

Observation of Eq. (4.4.5) is the proof that the transmission function  $\phi_2(\phi_1)$  is indeed a curve of second order. We recall that  $\phi_2(\phi_1)$  has been previously determined by nonlinear Eq. (4.3.13).

**Step 5.** In addition, it is necessary to determine the type of the second-order curve  $\sigma$  that might be an ellipse, a hyperbola, or a parabola. The solution is based on determination of the invariants of Eq. (4.4.4) (Korn & Korn, 1968). The investigation shows that

$$D = \begin{vmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{12} & a_{22} \end{vmatrix} < 0 \tag{4.4.6}$$

and therefore  $\sigma$  (represented by Eq. (4.4.5)) is a hyperbola. This conclusion has been confirmed as well numerically for elliptical gear drives with various values of ellipse eccentricity of the identical centrodes.

#### <span id="page-83-6"></span><span id="page-83-2"></span>4.5 Functional of Identical Centrodes

Some noncircular gear drives have identical centrodes – for instance, elliptical gear drives, oval gear drives, gear drives for generation of function 1/x, or those proposed by Tong and Yang (Tong & Yang, 1998).

Transmission function of gear drives with identical centrodes has a specific structure that may be recognized considering, for instance, function  $\phi_2(\phi_1)$  for elliptical gear drives (Fig. 4.3.3). In this case, function  $\phi_2(\phi_1)$  is formed by symmetry of branches (I, II) and (III, IV), respectively. Figures 4.5.1(a) and (b) illustrate

![](_page_84_Figure_2.jpeg)

the symmetry of branches *I* and *I I*. Similar illustrations may be provided as well for branches (*III*, *I V*) (see Fig. [4.3.3\)](#page-59-0).

The analysis of function φ2(φ1) for elliptical gears is based on the following considerations:

(1) Figure [4.5.2](#page-84-0) represents two small pieces of transmission function φ2(φ1) with the origin *O* ≡ *B*<sup>5</sup> (see Fig. [4.5.1\(](#page-82-2)b)) and function 1(2) with the origin *O* ≡ *A*<sup>5</sup> (see Fig. [4.5.1](#page-82-2) (b)). If identical centrodes indeed exist, then the following

![](_page_84_Figure_7.jpeg)

conditions must be observed:

<span id="page-85-0"></span>
$$\phi_2(\phi_1) = \Phi_1(\Phi_2), \quad \phi_{2max} = \phi_{1max}$$
 (4.5.1)

- (2) Equation [\(4.5.1\)](#page-85-0) confirms the following:
  - (a) Assume that the position of rotation of centrodes 1 and 2 corresponds to *A*5, and rotation is provided from centrode 2 to centrode 1 with the transmission function 1(2).
  - (b) Due to the identity of centrodes, rotation of centrode 1 with respect to centrode 2 (at the position of rotation *A*5) must be provided with observation of the equation 1(2) = φ2(φ1). Function φ2(φ1) relates rotation of centrode 2 with respect to centrode 1 at the position of rotation *B*5.
  - (c) Due to the identity of centrode 1 and 2, it must be observed as well that the maximal angles of rotation of centrodes 1 and 2 must be equal.
- (3) Consider now the instantaneous positions of the centrodes that correspond to point *M* of the graph *M* − *A*<sup>5</sup> of function φ2(φ1) (Fig. [4.5.2,](#page-84-1) branch *I*). It is easy to verify that *q* = φ1*max* − 1(2). However, because 1(2) and φ2(φ1) are related by Eq. [\(4.5.1\)](#page-85-0), we have

<span id="page-85-1"></span>
$$q = \phi_{1max} - \Phi_1(\Phi_2) = \phi_{1max} - \phi_2(\phi_1) = \phi_{1max} - F(\phi_1)$$
 (4.5.2)

Function *F*(*q*) is the same as *F*(φ1) ≡ φ2(φ1), so then we obtain

<span id="page-85-2"></span>
$$F(q) = \phi_{2max} - \Phi_2(\Phi_1) \tag{4.5.3}$$

Functions 2(1) and φ1(φ2) are the direct and inverted ones. We recall as well that φ2*max* = φ1*max*. We then obtain

$$F(q) = \phi_{2max} - \Phi_2(\Phi_1) = \phi_{2max} - \phi_1(\phi_2) = \phi_{1max} - \phi_1(\phi_2)$$
 (4.5.4)

Using Eqs. [\(4.5.2\)](#page-85-1) and [\(4.5.3\)](#page-85-2), we obtain

<span id="page-85-3"></span>
$$q = \phi_{1max} - F(\phi_1) \tag{4.5.5}$$

$$F(q) = \phi_{1max} - \phi_1 \tag{4.5.6}$$

It follows from Eq. [\(4.5.5\)](#page-85-3), and the meaning from operation *F*(*q*), that

<span id="page-85-4"></span>
$$F(q) = F(\phi_{1max} - F(\phi_1))$$
 (4.5.7)

Equations [\(4.5.5\)](#page-85-3) and [\(4.5.7\)](#page-85-4) yield the following final expression of the soughtfor functional for identical centrodes:

<span id="page-85-5"></span>
$$F(\phi_{1max} - F(\phi_1)) = \phi_{1max} - \phi_1$$
 (4.5.8)

We describe the application of Eq. [\(4.5.8\)](#page-85-5) for the case of identical centrodes of a drive that generates function *<sup>y</sup>* <sup>=</sup> <sup>1</sup> *x* .

**PROBLEM 4.5.1.** This example represents the design of noncircular gears for generation of function *<sup>y</sup>* <sup>=</sup> <sup>1</sup> *x* in the interval *x*<sup>1</sup> ≤ *x* ≤ *x*2. The design of the gear centrodes

is based on

<span id="page-86-0"></span>
$$\phi_1 = k_1(x - x_1) \tag{4.5.9}$$

$$\phi_2 = k_2(y_1 - y) = k_2 \left(\frac{1}{x_1} - \frac{1}{x}\right) \tag{4.5.10}$$

where

$$k_1 = \frac{\phi_{1max}}{x_2 - x_1}, \quad k_2 = \frac{\phi_{2max}}{\frac{1}{x_1} - \frac{1}{x_2}}, \quad (\phi_{2max} = \phi_{1max})$$
 (4.5.11)

Transmission function  $F(\phi_1)$  is

$$F(\phi_1) \equiv \phi_2(\phi_1) = \frac{k_2 \phi_1}{x_1 \phi_1 + k_1 x_1^2} = \frac{a_2 \phi_1}{a_3 + a_4 \phi_1}$$
(4.5.12)

where

$$a_2 = k_2, \quad a_3 = k_1 x_1^2, \quad a_4 = x_1$$
 (4.5.13)

The condition  $\phi_{2max} = \phi_{1max}$  of the identity of centrodes is observed; thus,  $\phi_{1max} = \frac{a_2 - a_3}{a_2 - a_3}$ .

The Functional (4.5.8) for the considered example of design is represented as

$$\frac{a_2(\phi_{1max} - F(\phi_1))}{a_3 + a_4(\phi_{1max} - F(\phi_1))} = \phi_{1max} - \phi_1$$
(4.5.14)

Observation of this equation is the proof of the identity of centrode 1 and 2 of the designed gear drive.

The centrodes of the gears are represented by

$$r_1(\phi_1) = \frac{E}{m_{12}(\phi_1) + 1} = \frac{a_2 a_3 E}{(a_3 + a_4 \phi_1)^2 + a_2 a_3}$$
(4.5.15)

where  $m_{12}(\phi_1)$  is the derivative function,

$$r_2(\phi_1) = E - r_1(\phi_1) = \frac{E(a_3 + a_4\phi_1)^2}{(a_3 + a_4\phi_1)^2 + a_2a_3}$$
(4.5.16)

$$\phi_2(\phi_1) = F(\phi_1) = \frac{a_2\phi_1}{a_3 + a_4\phi_1} \tag{4.5.17}$$

The centrodes are represented in Fig. 4.5.3.

#### **5.1 Introduction**

This chapter covers generation of planar and helical noncircular gears by a rack cutter, a hob, and a shaper. The cornerstone for determination of the generated tooth surfaces is the derivation of the equation of meshing of the generating and generated tooth surfaces. In this chapter, a matrix approach that allows the determination of relative velocity and equation of meshing to be simplified and computerized is presented. The developed theory will be illustrated with numerical examples of generation of planar and elliptical gears.

#### <span id="page-88-3"></span>**5.2 Generation of Elliptical Gears by Rack Cutter**

**ALGORITHM OF ROLLING MOTIONS.** The main idea of the enveloping method for generation of planar noncircular gears for the case of application of a rack cutter is described as follows (Fig. [5.2.1\)](#page-89-0):

- (i) Centrode 3 of the rack cutter is a straight line *t* − *t* that is a common tangent to centrodes 1 and 2 of mating noncircular gears 1 and 2 and rolls over 1 and 2.
- (ii) Rolling is provided wherein the rack cutter translates along tangent *t* − *t* and is rotated about the instantaneous center of rotation *I*.
- (iii) Tooth surfaces of gear 1, gear 2, and rack cutter 3 are in mesh simultaneously, and gear 1 and 2 are provided with conjugated surfaces.

The related motions of the rack cutter and the noncircular gear may be determined considering the motions of the generating tool and one of the centrodes of the gear set as follows (Fig. [5.2.2\)](#page-89-1):

- (a) The rack cutter centrode (denoted as *I*) is in mesh with centrode *I I* of a noncircular gear.
- (b) Rolling is provided by observation of

Equation (5.2.1) is obtained by considering that the rack cutter performs only translational motion with velocity  $\mathbf{v}^{(I)}$  along the common tangent to centrodes I and II. The noncircular gear II performs rotational motion about center of rotation  $O_{II}$ , and translational motion in the direction that is perpendicular to t-t. Vectors  $\mathbf{v}_{\text{rot}}^{(II)}$  and  $\mathbf{v}_{\text{tr}}^{(II)}$  represent velocities of gear II of rotational and translational motions (Fig. 5.2.2(a)). Figure 5.2.2(b) illustrates the positions of the rack cutter I and noncircular gear II in fixed coordinate system  $S_f$ . It will be shown that functions  $x_f^{(O_I)}(\phi^{(II)})$  and  $y_f^{(O_{II})}(\phi^{(II)})$  are nonlinear.

The derivation of the algorithm of rolling motions is based on application of the following planar coordinate systems (Figs. 5.2.3(a) and (b)): (i) movable coordinate systems  $S_c$  and  $S_1$  rigidly connected to the rack cutter and the noncircular gear, respectively, (ii) a fixed coordinate system  $S_f$ , and (iii) an auxiliary movable coordinate system  $S_n$  that performs translation along axis  $y_f$  (Fig. 5.2.3(b)).

Coordinate systems  $S_c$ ,  $S_1$ ,  $S_f$ , and  $S_n$  are planar; however, the developed algorithm of rolling developed for generation of planar noncircular gears may be applied for generation of helical noncircular gears as well (see following). The derivations are discussed for the case of elliptical gears. However, the obtained results may be applied for other types of noncircular gears.

Figure 5.2.3(a) and (b) show respectively the initial and current positions of the centrodes of the rack cutter c and the noncircular gear 1. The following is the preliminary information about the centrodes mentioned here and their motions performed during the meshing.

(1) The rack cutter centrode c is a straight line directed along axes  $x_c$ ,  $x_f$  (Fig. 5.2.3(b)) that performs translational motion along  $x_f$ .

(2) The centrode of noncircular gear 1 is an ellipse represented in polar form, according to Eq. (4.2.9), by

$$r(\theta) = \frac{a(1 - e^2)}{1 - e\cos\theta}$$
 (5.2.2)

Here, a is the major axis of the ellipse and e is the eccentricity of the ellipse (see Section 4.2.2). The polar axis of the ellipse is  $y_1$  (Fig. 5.2.3(b)). The ellipse centrode (during the meshing with the centrode of the rack cutter) performs:

- (i) Rotation about  $O_1$  (it is the focus of the ellipse), and
- (ii) Translational motion along axis  $y_n$  (Fig. 5.2.3(b)).
- (3) The instantaneous point of tangency of centrode c and 1 is  $M_1$  (Fig. 5.2.3(b)). Because centrode c and 1 roll over each other, the length of the arc  $M_0 M_1$  is equal to the distance  $|\overline{O_c M_1}|$ .
- (4) Parameter  $\psi_1$  determines the angular position of coordinate system  $S_1(x_1, y_1)$  with respect to  $S_f(x_f, y_f)$ .
- (5) Parameter  $\mu$  (Fig. 5.2.3(b)) determines orientation of the tangent to ellipse 1 at point  $M_1$ , where (see Section 2.5)

<span id="page-91-4"></span><span id="page-91-3"></span><span id="page-91-2"></span><span id="page-91-1"></span>
$$\tan \mu = \frac{r(\theta)}{\frac{dr}{d\theta}} \tag{5.2.3}$$

Observation of conditions of pure rolling yields the following relations between the motions of the rack cutter *c* and noncircular gear 1:

<span id="page-91-0"></span>
$$x_f^{(O_c)}(\theta) = -s(\theta) + r(\theta)\cos\mu = -\int_0^\theta \frac{r(\theta)}{\sin\mu} d\theta + r(\theta)\cos\mu \qquad (5.2.4)$$

$$y_f^{(O_1)}(\theta) = -r(\theta)\sin\mu\tag{5.2.5}$$

$$\psi_1(\theta) = \theta + \mu - \mu_0, \qquad \mu_0 = \frac{\pi}{2}$$
 (5.2.6)

$$\mu(\theta) = \arctan\left(-\frac{1 - e\cos\theta}{e\sin\theta}\right) \tag{5.2.7}$$

For the purpose of derivation of the equation of meshing, the derivation of the functions mentioned here is required. The results of derivation of Eqs. (5.2.4)–(5.2.7) with respect to polar angle  $\theta$  are as follows:

The derivative of polar vector  $r(\theta)$  is given by

$$\frac{dr(\theta)}{d\theta} = \frac{d}{d\theta} \frac{p}{1 - e\cos\theta} = \frac{-pe\sin\theta}{(1 - e\cos\theta)^2}$$
 (5.2.8)

The derivative of angle  $\mu(\theta)$  is given by

$$\frac{d\mu(\theta)}{d\theta} = \frac{d}{d\theta} \arctan \frac{-1 + e\cos\theta}{e\sin\theta} = \frac{-e(e - \cos\theta)}{1 + e(e - 2\cos\theta)}$$
 (5.2.9)

<span id="page-92-7"></span>The derivative of function  $s(\theta)$  is given by

$$\frac{ds(\theta)}{d\theta} = \frac{d}{d\theta} \int_0^\theta \frac{r(\theta)}{\sin \mu(\theta)} d\theta = \frac{r(\theta)}{\sin \mu(\theta)}$$
 (5.2.10)

The derivative of magnitude  $x_f^{(O_c)}(\theta)$  is then given by

<span id="page-92-4"></span>
$$\frac{dx_f^{(O_c)}}{d\theta} = \frac{d}{d\theta} \left[ -s(\theta) + r(\theta) \cos \mu(\theta) \right]$$

$$= -\frac{ds(\theta)}{d\theta} + \frac{dr(\theta)}{d\theta} \cos \mu(\theta) - r(\theta) \sin \mu(\theta) \frac{d\mu(\theta)}{d\theta} \qquad (5.2.11)$$

The derivative of magnitude  $y_f^{(O_1)}(\theta)$  is given by

<span id="page-92-5"></span>
$$\frac{dy_f^{(O_1)}}{d\theta} = \frac{d}{d\theta} \left[ -r(\theta) \sin \mu(\theta) \right] = -\frac{dr(\theta)}{d\theta} \sin \mu(\theta) - r(\theta) \cos \mu(\theta) \frac{d\mu(\theta)}{d\theta}$$
(5.2.12)

The derivative of magnitude  $\psi_1(\theta)$  is given by

<span id="page-92-6"></span>
$$\frac{d\psi_1}{d\theta} = \frac{d}{d\theta} \left[\theta + \mu - \frac{\pi}{2}\right] = 1 + \frac{d\mu(\theta)}{d\theta}$$
 (5.2.13)

**DERIVATION OF RACK CUTTER GENERATING SURFACES REPRESENTED IN COORDINATE SYSTEM S<sub>c</sub>.** Two types of generating surfaces are considered: (i) a planar rack cutter applied for generation of planar gears, represented in coordinate system  $S_t$  (Fig. 5.2.4(a)), and (ii) a skew rack cutter that is formed by the motion of  $S_t$  in coordinate system  $S_c$ , as illustrated in Fig. 5.2.4(b) and (c).

Surface  $\Sigma_c$  of the skew rack cutter and the surface unit normal are represented in  $S_c$  considering the coordinate transformation from  $S_t$  to  $S_c$ . The position vector  $\mathbf{r}_c(u_c, l_c)$  and surface normal  $\mathbf{n}_c$  of  $\Sigma_c$  are determined as

<span id="page-92-2"></span><span id="page-92-0"></span>
$$\mathbf{r}_{c}(u_{c}, l_{c}) = \begin{bmatrix} \left(\pm u_{c} \sin \alpha_{c} \mp \frac{\pi m_{n}}{4}\right) \cos \beta_{c} + l_{c} \sin \beta_{c} \\ u \cos \alpha_{c} \\ \left(\mp u_{c} \sin \alpha_{c} \pm \frac{\pi m_{n}}{4}\right) \sin \beta_{c} + l_{c} \cos \beta_{c} \end{bmatrix}$$
(5.2.14)

$$\mathbf{n}_{c} = \begin{bmatrix} \mp \cos \alpha_{c} \cos \beta_{c} \\ \sin \alpha_{c} \\ \pm \cos \alpha_{c} \sin \beta_{c} \end{bmatrix}$$

$$\mathbf{r}_1(u_c, l_c, \theta) = \mathbf{M}_{1c}(\theta)\mathbf{r}_c(u_c, l_c) = \mathbf{M}_{1n}(\theta)\mathbf{M}_{nf}(\theta)\mathbf{M}_{fc}(\theta)\mathbf{r}_c(u_c, l_c)$$

$$= \begin{bmatrix} \cos \psi_1 & \sin \psi_1 & 0 & 0 \\ -\sin \psi_1 & \cos \psi_1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & -y_f^{(O_1)} \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & x_f^{(O_c)} \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \mathbf{r}_c(u_c, l_c)$$

$$= \begin{bmatrix} \cos \psi_1 & \sin \psi_1 & 0 & x_f^{(O_c)} \cos \psi_1 - y_f^{(O_1)} \sin \psi_1 \\ -\sin \psi_1 & \cos \psi_1 & 0 & -x_f^{(O_c)} \sin \psi_1 - y_f^{(O_1)} \cos \psi_1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \mathbf{r}_c(u_c, l_c)$$
(5.2.18)

**MATRIX DERIVATION OF EQUATION OF MESHING**  $f_{1c}(u_c, l_c, \theta) = 0$ . We consider that the rack cutter is provided by generating surface  $\Sigma_c$  represented in 3D space by vector function  $\mathbf{r}_c(u_c, l_c)$ . Using coordinate transformation from coordinate system  $S_c$  to  $S_1$ , we obtain in  $S_1$  a family of generating surfaces  $\mathbf{r}_1(u_c, l_c, \theta)$ .

The generated surface of the noncircular gear is determined as the envelope to the family of surfaces  $\mathbf{r}_1(u_c, l_c, \theta)$ . In differential geometry (for instance, see Korn & Korn, 1968) the envelope to the family of surfaces  $\mathbf{r}_1(u_c, l_c, \theta)$  can be determined by simultaneous consideration of vector function  $\mathbf{r}_1(u_c, l_c, \theta)$  and the equation of meshing:

$$f(u_c, l_c, \theta) = \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{r}_1}{\partial u_c} \times \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}_1}{\partial l_c}\right) \cdot \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}_1}{\partial \theta} = 0$$
 (5.2.19)

A matrix approach for derivation of equation of meshing that allows us to simplify and computerize the determination of the surface generated by the rack cutter has been developed, and is performed as follows.

The family of generating rack-cutter surfaces is represented in coordinate system  $S_1$  in three-parametric form by Eq. (5.2.18). Considering Cartesian coordinates instead of homogeneous coordinates, the gear tooth surface may be obtained as

<span id="page-94-3"></span><span id="page-94-1"></span>
$$\rho_{1}(u_{c}, l_{c}, \theta) = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos \psi_{1} & \sin \psi_{1} & 0 \\
-\sin \psi_{1} & \cos \psi_{1} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\rho_{c}(u_{c}, l_{c}) + \begin{bmatrix}
\cos \psi_{1} & \sin \psi_{1} & 0 \\
-\sin \psi_{1} & \cos \psi_{1} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x_{f}^{(O_{c})} \\
-y_{f}^{(O_{1})} \\
0
\end{bmatrix}$$

$$= \mathbf{L}_{1c}\rho_{c} + \mathbf{L}_{1c}\mathbf{R}$$
(5.2.20)

<span id="page-95-4"></span><span id="page-95-3"></span>Here,

$$\mathbf{R} = \overline{\mathbf{O_n O_c}} = \begin{bmatrix} x_f^{(O_c)} & -y_f^{(O_1)} & 0 \end{bmatrix}^T$$
 (5.2.21)

The proposed approach allows us to obtain (i) the relative velocity of rack cutter c with respect to gear 1

$$\mathbf{v}_{1}^{(c1)} = \frac{d\boldsymbol{\rho}_{1}}{dt} = \dot{\mathbf{L}}_{1c}\boldsymbol{\rho}_{c} + \dot{\mathbf{L}}_{1c}\mathbf{R} + \mathbf{L}_{1c}\dot{\mathbf{R}}$$
 (5.2.22)

(ii) and the relative velocity of gear 1 with respect to rack cutter c

$$\mathbf{v}_{c}^{(1c)} = -\mathbf{L}_{c1}\mathbf{v}_{1}^{(c1)} = -\mathbf{L}_{c1}\left(\dot{\mathbf{L}}_{1c}\boldsymbol{\rho}_{c} + \dot{\mathbf{L}}_{1c}\mathbf{R} + \mathbf{L}_{1c}\dot{\mathbf{R}}\right)$$
(5.2.23)

The final expression of equation of meshing is

<span id="page-95-0"></span>
$$f_1^{(c1)}(u_c, l_c, \theta) = (\mathbf{L}_{1c}\mathbf{n}_c^{(c)}) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{L}}_{1c}\boldsymbol{\rho}_c + \dot{\mathbf{L}}_{1c}\mathbf{R} + \mathbf{L}_{1c}\dot{\mathbf{R}}) = 0$$
 (5.2.24)

or

<span id="page-95-2"></span><span id="page-95-1"></span>
$$f_c^{(1c)}(u_c, l_c, \theta) = \mathbf{n}_c^{(c)} \cdot \left[ -\mathbf{L}_{c1} \left( \dot{\mathbf{L}}_{1c} \boldsymbol{\rho}_c + \dot{\mathbf{L}}_{1c} \mathbf{R} + \mathbf{L}_{1c} \dot{\mathbf{R}} \right) \right] = 0$$
 (5.2.25)

where

$$\dot{\mathbf{L}}_{1c} = \begin{bmatrix} -\sin\psi_1 & \cos\psi_1 & 0\\ -\cos\psi_1 & -\sin\psi_1 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \dot{\psi}_1$$
 (5.2.26)

$$\dot{\mathbf{R}} = \frac{\dot{\mathbf{O}}_{\mathbf{n}} \mathbf{O}_{\mathbf{c}}}{\mathbf{O}_{\mathbf{c}}} = \begin{bmatrix} \dot{x}_f^{(O_c)} & -\dot{y}_f^{(O_1)} & 0 \end{bmatrix}^T$$
(5.2.27)

Derivatives  $\dot{x}_f^{(O_c)}$ ,  $\dot{y}_f^{(O_1)}$ , and  $\dot{\psi}_1$  are

$$\dot{x}_f^{(O_c)} = \frac{dx_f^{(O_c)}}{d\theta} \frac{d\theta}{dt} \tag{5.2.28}$$

$$\dot{y}_{f}^{(O_{1})} = \frac{dy_{f}^{(O_{1})}}{d\theta} \frac{d\theta}{dt}$$
 (5.2.29)

$$\dot{\psi}_1 = \frac{d\psi_1}{d\theta} \frac{d\theta}{dt} \tag{5.2.30}$$

where  $\frac{dx_f^{(O_c)}}{d\theta}$ ,  $\frac{dy_f^{(O_1)}}{d\theta}$ , and  $\frac{d\psi_1}{d\theta}$  are given by Eqs. (5.2.11), (5.2.12), and (5.2.13), respectively.

The tooth surface of the helical elliptical gear is determined by simultaneous consideration of Eq. (5.2.20) with Eq. (5.2.24) or (5.2.25).

#### **5.3 Generation of Elliptical Gears by Hob**

**DERIVATION OF WORM-THREAD GENERATING SURFACES REPRESENTED IN COORDINATE SYSTEM** *Sw***.** Application of a grinding worm or a hob for generation of elliptical gears is useful for an improvement of productivity and reliability of generated gears.

A worm-thread surface w, that is in imaginary meshing with rack-cutter tooth surface *c*, is being determined. Conditions of meshing between both surfaces, w and *c*, allows the worm-thread surface to be determined. The procedure is as follows:

(1) Worm and gear shafts form crossing angle γw*g*. Figure [5.3.1\(](#page-96-2)a) shows the installation of worm axode on rack-cutter axode plane . Angle γw*<sup>g</sup>* is given as

$$\gamma_{wg} = \frac{\pi}{2} - \beta_c + \lambda_w \tag{5.3.1}$$

wherein β*<sup>c</sup>* is the helix angle of the skew rack cutter and λw is the lead angle of the worm.

- (2) Line *t* − *t* at the pitch point *Of* , and the helix of the gear (see Fig. [5.3.1\(](#page-96-2)a)), are in tangency.
- (3) Moveable coordinate systems *Sc* and *S*<sup>w</sup> are rigidly connected to surfaces *<sup>c</sup>* and w, respectively. Fixed coordinate systems *Sf* and *Ss* are considered for

<span id="page-97-1"></span>definition of motions of rack-cutter and worm tooth surfaces, respectively (see Fig. 5.3.1(b)).

- (4) Surface  $\Sigma_c$  is considered as given and performs the following motions:
  - (i) Translation  $s_c$  of coordinate system  $S_c$  along the straight line  $O_f C$  (see Fig. 5.3.1(b)). Straight line  $O_f C$  forms angle  $\gamma_{wg}$  with respect to axis  $x_f$  (see Fig. 5.3.1(a)).
  - (ii) Rotation of coordinate system  $S_w$  about axis  $z_s$  an angle  $\psi_w$ , determined as

$$\psi_w = \frac{s_c}{\rho_w} \tag{5.3.2}$$

wherein  $\rho_w$  is the pitch radius of the griding worm.

(5) Worm-thread surface  $\Sigma_w$  is obtained by simultaneous consideration of vector equation

$$\mathbf{r}_w(u_c, l_c, \psi_w) = \mathbf{M}_{wc}(\psi_w)\mathbf{r}_c(u_c, l_c)$$
(5.3.3)

and equation of meshing

<span id="page-97-0"></span>
$$\left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{r}_c}{\partial u_c} \times \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}_c}{\partial l_c}\right) \cdot \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}_c}{\partial \psi_w} = 0 \tag{5.3.4}$$

Here,  $\psi_w$  is the generalized parameter of meshing, and  $\mathbf{M}_{wc}$  is a 4 × 4 matrix that represents coordinate transformation of homogeneous coordinates from system  $S_c$  to system  $S_w$ . However, we will apply for derivation of Eq. (5.3.4), the matrix approach presented for the case of rack-cutter generation.

Worm-thread surface  $\Sigma_w$  may be considered for the purpose of simplicity as a surface with two independent parameters  $(h_w, \varepsilon_w)$ .

**GENERATION OF SURFACE**  $\Sigma_1$  **OF ELLIPTICAL GEAR BY A WORM.** The derivation of  $\Sigma_1$  by a worm-thread surface  $\Sigma_w$  is based on the following procedure (see Fig. 5.3.2):

- (i) Two coordinate systems  $S_w$  and  $S_1$  are rigidly connected to the worm-thread surface and the to-be-determined gear-tooth surface. A fixed reference system  $S_f$  is considered for definition of motions of systems  $S_w$  and  $S_1$ .
- (ii) Worm-thread surface  $\Sigma_w$  is given by vector function  $\mathbf{R}_w(h_w, \varepsilon_w)$ .
- (iii) Two sets of motions are provided to the worm:
  - (a) Rotation of the worm about axis  $z_w$  on angle  $\phi_w$ .
  - (b) Translation  $s_w$  along axis  $z_f$  that is parallel to the axis of the gear. Coordinate system  $S_s$  is a movable coordinate system that is translated with system  $S_w$ .
- (iv) Rotation and translation of the worm are accompanied by rotation and translation of the elliptical gear as follows:
  - (a) Rotation  $\psi_1$  about axis  $z_1$  of the gear.
  - (b) Translation defined by position  $y_f^{(O_1)}$  along axis  $y_f$ .

<span id="page-98-0"></span>Magnitudes  $\psi_1$  and  $y_f^{(O_1)}$  may be determined as functions of polar angle  $\theta$  (see Eqs. (5.2.5) and (5.2.6)). Magnitudes  $\psi_1$  and  $y_f^{(O_1)}$  are related with motions  $\phi_w$  and  $s_w$  by functions

$$y_f^{(O_1)}(\theta) = -r(\theta)\sin\mu\tag{5.3.5}$$

$$\psi_1(\theta) = \theta + \mu - \mu_0, \qquad \mu_0 = \frac{\pi}{2}$$
 (5.3.6)

and the new function to be determined as

$$g(\phi_w, s_w, \theta) = 0 \tag{5.3.7}$$

<span id="page-99-3"></span>(v) Coordinate transformation between systems  $S_w$  and  $S_1$  determines the family of worm-thread surfaces in system  $S_1$  as

<span id="page-99-0"></span>
$$\mathbf{r}_1(h_w, \varepsilon_w, \phi_w, s_w) = \mathbf{M}_{1w}(\phi_w, s_w)\mathbf{R}_w(h_w, \varepsilon_w)$$
 (5.3.8)

Here,  $\phi_w$  and  $s_w$  are independent generalized parameters of motion, which means that the generation is a double-enveloping process, and  $4 \times 4$  matrix  $\mathbf{M}_{1w}$  describes coordinate transformation from system  $S_w$  to system  $S_1$ . Derivation of Eq. (5.3.8) is performed as

$$\mathbf{r}_{1}(h_{w}, \varepsilon_{w}, \phi_{w}, s_{w}) = \mathbf{M}_{1f}(\phi_{w}, s_{w})\mathbf{M}_{fs}(s_{w})\mathbf{M}_{sw}(\phi_{w})\mathbf{R}_{w}(h_{w}, \varepsilon_{w})$$
(5.3.9)

wherein

$$\mathbf{M}_{1f}(\phi_w, s_w) = \begin{bmatrix} \cos \psi_1 & \sin \psi_1 & 0 & -y_f^{(O_1)} \sin \psi_1 \\ -\sin \psi_1 & \cos \psi_1 & 0 & -y_f^{(O_1)} \cos \psi_1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$$
(5.3.10)

$$\mathbf{M}_{fs}(s_w) = \begin{bmatrix} \cos \gamma_{wg} & 0 & -\sin \gamma_{wg} & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & \rho_w \\ \sin \gamma_{wg} & 0 & \cos \gamma_{wg} & s_w \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$$
(5.3.11)

$$\mathbf{M}_{sw}(\phi_w) = \begin{bmatrix} \cos \phi_w & -\sin \phi_w & 0 & 0\\ \sin \phi_w & \cos \phi_w & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$$
(5.3.12)

(vi) Because generation of surface  $\Sigma_1$  of the elliptical gear involves a double-enveloping process, there are two equations of meshing,

<span id="page-99-1"></span>
$$f_1^{(w1)}(h_w, \varepsilon_w, \phi_w, s_w) = 0 (5.3.13)$$

<span id="page-99-2"></span>
$$f_2^{(w1)}(h_w, \varepsilon_w, \phi_w, s_w) = 0$$
 (5.3.14)

that relate parameters  $(h_w, \varepsilon_w, \phi_w, s_w)$ . Simultaneous consideration of Eqs. (5.3.8), (5.3.13), and (5.3.14) determine surface  $\Sigma_1$  of the elliptical gear.

**DERIVATION OF FUNCTION**  $g(\phi_w, s_w, \theta) = 0$  The derivation is performed as follows (see Fig. 5.3.3):

![](_page_100_Figure_2.jpeg)

Figure 5.3.3. For determination of function  $g(\phi_w, s_w, \theta) = 0$ .

- <span id="page-100-0"></span>(i) An imaginary rack cutter is considered being in simultaneous meshing with the elliptical gear and the worm. At the initial position, system  $S_c$  coincides with system  $S_f$ , and common tangent line t-t between the three surfaces,  $\Sigma_w$ ,  $\Sigma_1$ , and  $\Sigma_c$ , is at position  $t_0$ .
- (ii) Due to rotation and translation of the worm on  $\phi_w$  and  $s_w$ , the common tangent t-t will take position  $t_2$ . The location of system  $S_c$  in  $S_f$  is determined by  $x_f^{(O_c)}$ .
- (iii) Displacement of system  $S_c$  may be obtained as the sum of independent displacements  $\Delta x_{f1}^{(O_c)}$  and  $\Delta x_{f2}^{(O_c)}$ :

$$\Delta x_f^{(O_c)} = \Delta x_{f1}^{(O_c)} + \Delta x_{f2}^{(O_c)}$$
 (5.3.15)

Displacement  $\Delta x_{f1}^{(O_c)} = \overline{O_f S}$  is caused by translation  $s_w$  and is defined by positions  $t_0$  and  $t_1$ . Displacement  $\Delta x_{f2}^{(O_c)} = \overline{SO_c}$  is caused by rotation  $\phi_w$  and is defined by positions  $t_1$  and  $t_2$ .

<span id="page-101-1"></span><span id="page-101-0"></span>(iv) Illustrations of Fig. 5.3.3(b) yield

$$-\Delta x_{f1}^{(O_c)} = \overline{O_f S} = \tan \beta_c s_w \tag{5.3.16}$$

$$-\Delta x_{f2}^{(O_c)} = \overline{SO_C} = \frac{p_w \cos \lambda_w}{\cos \beta_c} \phi_w$$
 (5.3.17)

where  $p_w$  is the pitch of the worm.

(v) Because  $x_f^{(O_c)}$  depends on polar angle  $\theta$  (see Eq. (5.2.4)), function  $g(\phi_w, s_w, \theta) = 0$  is obtained finally as

$$g(\phi_w, s_w, \theta) = x_f^{(O_c)}(\theta) + \tan \beta_c s_w + \frac{p_w \cos \lambda_w}{\cos \beta_c} \phi_w = 0$$
 (5.3.18)

**MATRIX DERIVATION OF EQUATIONS OF MESHING.** Matrix derivation of equations of meshing  $f_1^{(w1)}(h_w, \varepsilon_w, \phi_w, s_w) = 0$  and  $f_2^{(w1)}(h_w, \varepsilon_w, \phi_w, s_w) = 0$  is performed as follows:

(i) Vector position  $\mathbf{r}_1(h_w, \varepsilon_w, \phi_w, s_w)$  in homogeneous coordinates is given by

$$\mathbf{r}_{1}(h_{w}, \varepsilon_{w}, \phi_{w}, s_{w}) = \mathbf{M}_{1w}(\phi_{w}, s_{w})\mathbf{R}_{w}(h_{w}, \varepsilon_{w})$$

$$= \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} & \sin \psi_{1}(\rho_{w} - y_{f}^{(O_{1})}) \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} & \cos \psi_{1}(\rho_{w} - y_{f}^{(O_{1})}) \\ a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} & s_{w} \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \mathbf{R}_{w}(h_{w}, \varepsilon_{w})$$
(5.3.19)

wherein

$$a_{11} = \cos \psi_1 \cos \gamma_{wg} \cos \phi_w + \sin \psi_1 \sin \phi_w \tag{5.3.20}$$

$$a_{12} = -\cos\psi_1\cos\gamma_{wg}\sin\phi_w + \sin\psi_1\cos\phi_w \tag{5.3.21}$$

$$a_{13} = -\cos\psi_1 \sin\gamma_{wg} \tag{5.3.22}$$

$$a_{21} = -\sin\psi_1\cos\gamma_{wg}\cos\phi_w + \cos\psi_1\sin\phi_w \tag{5.3.23}$$

$$a_{22} = \sin \psi_1 \cos \gamma_{wg} \sin \phi_w + \cos \psi_1 \cos \phi_w$$
 (5.3.24)

$$a_{23} = \sin \psi_1 \sin \gamma_{wg} \tag{5.3.25}$$

$$a_{31} = \sin \gamma_{wg} \cos \phi_w \tag{5.3.26}$$

$$a_{32} = -\sin \gamma_{wg} \sin \phi_w \tag{5.3.27}$$

$$a_{33} = \cos \gamma_{wg} \tag{5.3.28}$$

(ii) Vector position  $\mathbf{r}_1(h_w, \varepsilon_w, \phi_w, s_w)$  is denoted as  $\boldsymbol{\rho}_1(h_w, \varepsilon_w, \phi_w, s_w)$  in Cartesian coordinates and may be represented as

$$\rho_{1}(h_{w}, \varepsilon_{w}, \phi_{w}, s_{w}) = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\ a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} \end{bmatrix} \rho_{w}(h_{w}, \varepsilon_{w}) + \begin{bmatrix} \sin \psi_{1}(\rho_{w} - y_{f}^{(O_{1})}) \\ \cos \psi_{1}(\rho_{w} - y_{f}^{(O_{1})}) \\ s_{w} \end{bmatrix}$$

$$= \mathbf{L}_{1w}(\phi_w, s_w)\rho_w(h_w, \varepsilon_w) + \mathbf{R}$$
 (5.3.29)

Here,  $\mathbf{L}_{1w}$  is a  $3 \times 3$  matrix obtained by eliminating the last row and the last column of  $4 \times 4$  matrix  $\mathbf{M}_{1w}$ . Matrix  $\mathbf{L}_{1w}$  may be also obtained as

$$\mathbf{L}_{1w} = \mathbf{L}_{1f} \mathbf{L}_{fs} \mathbf{L}_{sw} \tag{5.3.30}$$

whereas vector  $\mathbf{R}$  is defined as

$$\mathbf{R} = \left[ \sin \psi_1 (\rho_w - y_f^{(O_1)}) - \cos \psi_1 (\rho_w - y_f^{(O_1)}) - s_w \right]^T$$
 (5.3.31)

(iii) Considering  $s_w$  as constant ( $s_w = c$ ), the relative velocity of the worm-thread surface with respect to gear tooth surface may be obtained as

$$\mathbf{v}_{1,s_{w}=c}^{(w1)} = \dot{\boldsymbol{\rho}}_{1} = \dot{\mathbf{L}}_{1w}\rho_{w} + \dot{\mathbf{R}}$$
 (5.3.32)

wherein

$$\dot{\mathbf{L}}_{1w} = \dot{\mathbf{L}}_{1f} \mathbf{L}_{fs} \mathbf{L}_{sw} + \mathbf{L}_{1f} \mathbf{L}_{fs} \dot{\mathbf{L}}_{sw}$$
 (5.3.33)

$$\dot{\mathbf{L}}_{1f} = \begin{bmatrix} -\sin\psi_1 & \cos\psi_1 & 0\\ -\cos\psi_1 & -\sin\psi_1 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \dot{\psi}_1$$
 (5.3.34)

$$\dot{\mathbf{L}}_{sw} = \begin{bmatrix} -\sin\phi_w & -\cos\phi_w & 0\\ \cos\phi_w & -\sin\phi_w & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \dot{\phi}_w, \quad \dot{\phi}_w = -\frac{\cos\beta_c}{p_w\cos\lambda_w} \dot{x}_f^{(O_c)} \quad (5.3.35)$$

$$\dot{\mathbf{R}} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos \psi_1 (\rho_w - y_f^{(O_1)}) \dot{\psi}_1 - \sin \psi_1 \dot{y}_f^{(O_1)} \\ -\sin \psi_1 (\rho_w - y_f^{(O_1)}) \dot{\psi}_1 - \cos \psi_1 \dot{y}_f^{(O_1)} \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$$
(5.3.36)

Then, the equation of meshing may be obtained as

$$f_1^{(w1)} = \mathbf{n}_1 \cdot \mathbf{v}_{1,s_w=c}^{(w1)} = 0$$
 (5.3.37)

wherein

#### 5.4 Generation of Elliptical Gears by Shaper

**DERIVATION OF SURFACE**  $\Sigma_1$  **OF ELLIPTICAL GEAR GENERATED BY SHAPER.** The derivation of the surface  $\Sigma_1$  of a elliptical gear generated by a shaper is based on the following procedure:

- (1) Two coordinate systems  $S_s$  and  $S_1$  are considered rigidly connected to the shaper and the to-be-determined surface.
- (2) An involute tooth surface  $\mathbf{r}_s(u_s, \theta_s)$  is considered as given for a shaper with pitch radius  $\rho_s$ .

(5) Coordinate system  $S_n$  is translated with system  $S_1$  on magnitudes  $x_f^{(O_1)}$  and  $y_f^{(O_1)}$  while system  $S_1$  is rotated on the magnitude  $\psi_1$ . Such magnitudes may be represented as functions of polar angle  $\theta$ :

#### **6.1** Introduction

The advantage of a gear drive formed by an eccentric circular gear and its conjugated noncircular gear (called for the purpose of abbreviation *eccentric gear drive*) is the simplification of the generation of the driving gear designed as a circular gear with displaced center of rotation. Figure 6.1.1 shows an eccentric involute pinion and the conjugated noncircular gear. The noncircular gear of the eccentric gear drive may be designed and generated with straight or helical teeth.

The eccentric gear drive is competitive to the one formed by elliptical gears (see Chapter 5). In this chapter, the geometry and design of eccentric gear drives will be described and methods of generation of the eccentric gear and its conjugated noncircular gear by a hob (in case of having convex centrodes) and by a shaper (in case of having convex-concave centrodes) will be presented.

#### 6.2 Centrodes of Eccentric Gear Drive

#### 6.2.1 Equations of Mating Centrodes

Figures 6.2.1 shows centrodes  $\sigma_1$  and  $\sigma_2$  in initial and current positions. Centrode  $\sigma_1$  is an eccentric circle of radius  $r_{p1}$  and is represented in polar form as (Fig. 6.2.1(b))

$$r_1(\theta_1) = \left(r_{p_1}^2 - e_1^2 \sin^2 \theta_1\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} - e_1 \cos \theta_1 \tag{6.2.1}$$

where parameter  $\theta_1$  determines the position of  $r_1(\theta_1)$  with respect to polar axis  $\overline{O_1 A_1}$  (Fig. 6.2.1(b)).

Henceforth, we will use representation of a centrode in terms of derivative function  $m_{12}(\phi_1)$  (see Section 2.4), where  $\phi_i = \theta_i$  (i = 1, 2) is the angle of rotation of the centrodes; parameter  $\theta_i$  determines location of  $r_i(\theta_i)$  with respect to polar axis  $\overline{O_i A_i}$ . For  $\sigma_1$ , we have

$$r_1(\phi_1) = \frac{E}{1 + m_{12}(\phi_1)} \tag{6.2.2}$$

<span id="page-112-2"></span>![](_page_112_Figure_2.jpeg)

<span id="page-112-0"></span>Figure 6.1.1. Eccentric involute pinion and conjugated noncircular gear: (a) eccentric helical drive, (b) eccentric planar drive.  $O_1$  and  $O_2$  are the centers of rotation of pinion and gear, respectively; O is the geometric center of the pinion.

Centrode  $\sigma_2$  is represented by

$$r_2(\phi_1) = E \frac{m_{12}(\phi_1)}{1 + m_{12}(\phi_1)}$$
(6.2.3)

$$\phi_2(\phi_1) = \int_0^{\phi_1} \frac{d\phi_1}{m_{12}(\phi_1)} \tag{6.2.4}$$

Here, the derivative function is

<span id="page-112-1"></span>
$$m_{12}(\phi_1) = \frac{E - r_1(\phi_1)}{r_1(\phi_1)} = \frac{c_1}{\left(1 - \varepsilon_1^2 \sin^2 \phi_1\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} - \varepsilon_1 \cos \phi_1} - 1$$
 (6.2.5)

where  $c_1 = E/r_{p1}$  and  $\varepsilon_1 = e_1/r_{p1}$ . Function  $\phi_2(\phi_1)$  is the transmission function, and its determination requires numerical integration.

<span id="page-113-2"></span><span id="page-113-1"></span><span id="page-113-0"></span>![](_page_113_Picture_2.jpeg)

Figure 6.2.1. For derivation of centrodes: (a) initial position; (b) current position.

Centrode  $\sigma_1$  is already a closed-form curve (a circle of radius  $r_{p1}$ ). Centrode  $\sigma_2$  will be a closed-form curve by observation of

$$\phi_2(\phi_1) = \frac{2\pi}{n} = \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{d\phi_1}{m_{12}(\phi_1)}$$
 (6.2.6)

wherein n is the number of revolutions that the eccentric gear 1 performs for one revolution of the noncircular gear.

Derivation of centrodes  $\sigma_1$  and  $\sigma_2$  enables us to design as well a cam mechanism with a constant center distance between the follower as an eccentric circle and a cam for generation of functions. The cam is determined as the centrode of the noncircular gear of the eccentric drive.

#### **6.2.2** Curvature of Centrode $\sigma_2$ and Applications

**BASIC DERIVATIONS.** Knowledge of curvature of centrode  $\sigma_2$  is necessary for: (i) choosing the method of generation of the gears by a hob or by a shaper, and (ii) for avoidance of undercutting of tooth profiles.

Considering that a centrode is represented by a polar curve  $r(\theta)$ , its curvature radius may be determined (see Section 2.8) as

$$\rho(\theta) = \frac{\left[r(\theta)^2 + \left(\frac{dr}{d\theta}\right)^2\right]^{\frac{3}{2}}}{r(\theta)^2 + 2\left(\frac{dr}{d\theta}\right)^2 - r(\theta)\frac{d^2r}{d\theta^2}}$$
(6.2.7)

Figure 6.2.2. For derivation of curvature radius ρ2(φ1) of centrode σ2.

The condition of convexity of the polar curve may be represented as

$$\kappa = \frac{1}{\rho} = r(\theta)^2 + 2\left(\frac{dr}{d\theta}\right)^2 - r(\theta)\frac{d^2r}{d\theta^2} \ge 0$$
 (6.2.8)

or by an alternative inequality

$$\sin \mu \left[ r(\theta)(2 - \sin^2 \mu) - \sin^2 \mu \frac{d^2 r}{d\theta^2} \right] \ge 0 \tag{6.2.9}$$

Here, angle <sup>µ</sup> <sup>=</sup> arctan *<sup>r</sup>*(θ) *dr*/*d*θ is formed by position vector *r*(θ) and tangent *t* to the polar curve (see Section [2.5\)](#page-39-2); κ is the curvature of the polar curve.

Taken into account that the curvature of centrode σ<sup>1</sup> is known, determination of κ<sup>2</sup> can be obtained by using Euler-Savary equation [\(Hartenberg & Denavit, 1964\)](#page-218-14), which relates curvatures κ<sup>1</sup> and κ<sup>2</sup> of centrodes σ<sup>1</sup> and σ<sup>2</sup> of the eccentric gear drive (Fig. [6.2.2\)](#page-114-0) as

<span id="page-114-1"></span>
$$\frac{1}{\rho_1} + \frac{1}{\rho_2} = \left[ \frac{1}{r_1(\phi_1)} + \frac{1}{r_2(\phi_1)} \right] \sin \mu_1 \tag{6.2.10}$$

Here,

$$\frac{1}{\rho_1} = \frac{1}{r_{p1}} = \kappa_1, \qquad \frac{1}{\rho_2} = \kappa_2$$
 (6.2.11)

where ρ<sup>2</sup> = |*I A*2| (Fig. [6.2.2\)](#page-114-0), and

$$r_2(\phi_1) = E - r_1(\phi_1) \tag{6.2.12}$$

Equation [\(6.2.10\)](#page-114-1) yields

$$\kappa_2 = \left[ \frac{1}{r_1(\phi_1)} + \frac{1}{E - r_1(\phi_1)} \right] \sin \mu_1 - \kappa_1 \tag{6.2.13}$$

It is known from kinematics of a four-bar linkage that point F (of intersection of extended links 1 and 3) is the instantaneous center of rotation of link 2 with respect to link 4. Vector  $\overline{IF}$  is perpendicular to  $\overline{O_1O_2}$ , and its magnitude is determined as

$$|\overline{IF}| = \frac{r_1(\phi_1) - \rho_1 \sin \mu_1}{\rho_1 r_1(\phi_1)} = \frac{|\rho_2 \sin \mu_1 - r_2(\phi_1)|}{\rho_2 r_2(\phi_1)}$$

**AVOIDANCE OF UNDERCUTTING.** Drawings of Fig. 6.2.4 show generation of an involute spur gear with a rack cutter of profile angle  $\alpha_c$ . The centrode of the rack cutter is its middle line. The centrode of the gear is the pitch circle of radius  $r_p$ . Undercutting of the involute gear is avoided by the installment of the rack cutter wherein

$$\frac{m}{\sin^2 \alpha_c} \le r_p \tag{6.2.16}$$

Avoidance of undercutting of the noncircular gear of eccentric gear drive is based on the following considerations:

(i) Gear 2 of the drive has various tooth profiles, but they may be represented (approximately) as tooth profiles of respective circular gears with curvatures of radii  $\rho_A, \rho_B, \ldots, \rho_K$  (Fig. 6.2.5).

- (ii) Radius  $\rho_2^{(A)}$  of curvature of centrode  $\sigma_2$  for point A corresponds to profiles of the tooth denoted as  $\Sigma_A$ . Similarly, profiles of tooth  $\Sigma_B$  are represented as those of spur gears of radius  $\rho_2^{(B)}$ , and so on (Fig. 6.2.5).
- (iii) Undercutting occurs for a tooth with the smallest radius  $\rho_2$  of the substituting circular gear.

Here, n is the number of revolutions of eccentric gear 1 that is performed for one revolution of driven gear 2 with centrode  $\sigma_2$ .
- (v) The idea of application of substituting circular gears may be applied for avoidance of undercutting for all eccentric gear drives with centrodes  $\sigma_1$  and  $\sigma_2$ . For this purpose, it is necessary to obtain functions  $\rho_2^{(A)}(\varepsilon, n)$  (Fig. 6.2.5(b)) that represent the minimal curvature radius of  $\rho_2$ . Point A is the point of centrode  $\sigma_2$  (Fig. 6.2.5(a)) where  $\rho_2 = \rho_{2,min}$ , and  $\varepsilon = e/r_p$  (see Eq. (6.2.5)).
- (vi) Avoidance of undercutting for all eccentric gear drives is obtained by choosing such a module for which functions  $\frac{\rho_2^{(A)}}{m}$  will be out of the square with the height  $1/\sin^2\alpha_c$  (Fig. 6.2.5(b)).

#### 6.3 Generation of the Noncircular Gear by Shaper and Hob

In this section, the algorithms that relate the motions of the generating tool (shaper, hob) and the noncircular gear of the drive being generated will be formulated. Such relations are represented by nonlinear equations and are the basis of computerized generation of the noncircular gear.

The eccentric gear of the drive may be generated as a conventional involute gear, with the observation by manufacturing and assembly of the location of the geometric center with respect to the center of rotation. In addition, for the purpose of localization of the bearing contact it is necessary to provide double-crowning to the surfaces of the teeth of the eccentric gear.

There is the possibility of generation of the noncircular gear by a shaper that is identical to the eccentric involute gear of the drive. This allows manufacturing the noncircular gear observing a constant center distance between the shaper and noncircular gear being generated. However, the identity of the shaper and the eccentric involute gear has an unfavorable limitation and has not been applied by the authors.

#### 6.3.1 Generation of Noncircular Gear by a Noneccentric Shaper

**DERIVATION OF SURFACE**  $\Sigma_2$  **OF NONCIRCULAR GEAR GENERATED BY SHAPER.** We recall that the shaper is not identical to the involute eccentric gear of the drive. The derivation is based on the following procedure:

- (1) Two coordinate systems  $S_s$  and  $S_2$  are considered rigidly connected to the shaper and the to-be-determined surface.
- (2) An involute tooth surface  $\mathbf{r}_s(u_s, v_s)$  is considered as given for a shaper with pitch radius  $\rho_s$ , which may differ from  $\rho_1$ .
- (3) Coordinate system  $S_s$  is rotated while coordinate system  $S_2$  is rotated and translated. Motions of systems  $S_s$  and  $S_2$  are defined by kinematic relation of their centrodes (see Fig. 6.3.1):

$$\mathbf{v}_I^{(s)} = \mathbf{v}_I^{(2)} \tag{6.3.1}$$

(4) Coordinate system *Ss* is rotated on ψ*<sup>s</sup>* that is related with polar angle θ<sup>2</sup> by

$$\psi_s = \frac{s(\theta_2)}{\rho_s} \tag{6.3.3}$$

wherein *s*(θ2) is a function of the polar angle θ<sup>1</sup> of the eccentric gear,

$$s(\theta_2) = \rho_1(\theta_1 - \arcsin(\varepsilon_1 \sin \theta_1)) \tag{6.3.4}$$

<span id="page-120-3"></span><span id="page-120-2"></span>(5) Coordinate system  $S_n$  is translated with system  $S_2$  on magnitudes  $x_f^{(O_2)}$  and  $y_f^{(O_2)}$  while system  $S_2$  is rotated on the magnitude  $\psi_2$ . Such magnitudes may be represented as functions of polar angle  $\theta_2$ :

$$x_f^{(O_2)} = -r(\theta_2)\cos\mu_2\tag{6.3.5}$$

$$y_f^{(O_2)} = r(\theta_2) \sin \mu_2 \tag{6.3.6}$$

$$\psi_2 = \theta_2 + \mu_2 - \frac{\pi}{2} \tag{6.3.7}$$

Functions  $r(\theta_2)$ ,  $\theta_2$ , and  $\mu_2$  may be expressed as functions of polar angle  $\theta_1$  as

$$r(\theta_2) = E - r(\theta_1) = E - \rho_1 \left( \sqrt{1 - \varepsilon_1^2 \sin^2 \theta_1} - \varepsilon_1 \cos \theta_1 \right)$$
 (6.3.8)

$$\theta_2 = \int_0^{\theta_1} \left( \frac{c_1}{c_1 - \sqrt{1 - \varepsilon_1^2 \sin^2 \theta_1} + \varepsilon_1 \cos \theta_1} - 1 \right) d\theta_1 \tag{6.3.9}$$

$$\mu_2(\theta_1) = \arctan\left(\frac{\sqrt{1 - \varepsilon_1^2 \sin^2 \theta_1}}{-\varepsilon_1 \sin \theta_1}\right),$$
(6.3.10)

(6) Noncircular gear-tooth surface  $\Sigma_2$  is obtained by simultaneous consideration of matrix transformation

<span id="page-120-0"></span>
$$\mathbf{r}_2(u_s, v_s, \theta_2) = \mathbf{M}_{2s}(\theta_2)\mathbf{r}_s(u_s, v_s)$$

$$(6.3.11)$$

and equation of meshing

$$f(u_s, v_s, \theta_2) = \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{r}_2}{\partial u_s} \times \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}_2}{\partial v_s}\right) \cdot \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}_2}{\partial \theta_2} = 0 \tag{6.3.12}$$

(6.3.13)

Here,

$$\mathbf{M}_{2n} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos \psi_2 & -\sin \psi_2 & 0 & 0\\ \sin \psi_2 & \cos \psi_2 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{M}_{nf} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & -x_f^{(O_2)}\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & -y_f^{(O_2)}\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$$

(6.3.15)

Relative velocity  $\mathbf{v}_2^{(s2)}$  is given as

$$\mathbf{v}_2^{(s2)} = \dot{\boldsymbol{\rho}}_2 = (\dot{\mathbf{L}}_{2n} \mathbf{L}_{nf} \mathbf{L}_{fs} + \mathbf{L}_{2n} \mathbf{L}_{nf} \dot{\mathbf{L}}_{fs}) \boldsymbol{\rho}_s + \dot{\mathbf{R}}$$
(6.3.16)

Derivations of derivatives  $\dot{\psi}_2$ ,  $\dot{\psi}_s$ ,  $\dot{x}_f^{(O_2)}$ , and  $\dot{y}_f^{(O_2)}$  are obtained as

<span id="page-121-0"></span>
$$\dot{\psi}_2 = \left(\frac{d\theta_2}{d\theta_1} + \frac{d\mu_2}{d\theta_1}\right) \frac{d\theta_1}{dt}$$

$$\dot{y}_f^{(O_2)} = \frac{dy_f^{(O_2)}}{d\theta_1} \frac{d\theta_1}{dt}$$

Derivatives  $\frac{d\theta_2}{d\theta_1}$ ,  $\frac{d\mu_2}{d\theta_2}$ ,  $\frac{ds(\theta_2)}{d\theta_2}$ ,  $\frac{dx_f^{(O_2)}}{d\theta_2}$ , and  $\frac{dy_f^{(O_2)}}{d\theta_2}$  are given by:

$$\frac{d\theta_2}{d\theta_1} = \frac{c_1}{c_1 - \sqrt{1 - \varepsilon_1^2 \sin^2 \theta_1} + \varepsilon_1 \cos \theta_1} - 1 \tag{6.3.17}$$

$$\frac{d\mu_2}{d\theta_1} = \varepsilon_1^2 \sin^2 \theta_1 \tag{6.3.18}$$

$$\frac{ds(\theta_2)}{d\theta_1} = \rho_1 \left( 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \varepsilon_1^2 \sin^2 \theta_1}} \right) \tag{6.3.19}$$

$$\frac{dx_f^{(O_2)}}{d\theta_1} = -\rho_1 \left( \frac{\varepsilon_1^2 \sin \theta_1 \cos \theta_1}{\sqrt{1 - \varepsilon_1^2 \sin^2 \theta_1}} - \varepsilon_1 \sin \theta_1 \right) \cos \mu_2$$

<span id="page-121-1"></span>
$$+r(\theta_2)\sin\mu_2\varepsilon_1^2\sin^2\theta_1\tag{6.3.20}$$

$$\frac{dy_f^{(O_2)}}{d\theta_1} = \rho_1 \left( \frac{\varepsilon_1^2 \sin \theta_1 \cos \theta_1}{\sqrt{1 - \varepsilon_1^2 \sin^2 \theta_1}} - \varepsilon_1 \sin \theta_1 \right) \sin \mu_2$$

 (6.3.23)

#### **6.3.2 Generation of the Noncircular Gear by a Hob**

**INSTALLATION OF HOB.** Generation of noncircular gear-tooth surface <sup>2</sup> by a wormthread surface w is being considered. For the purpose of simplicity, an imaginary rack-cutter tooth surface *<sup>c</sup>* is considered in continuous tangency with surfaces <sup>2</sup> and w.

Figure [6.3.2\(](#page-122-2)a) shows worm, rack cutter, and noncircular gear at their initial positions. Point *Of* is the common point of tangency of three surfaces 2, w, and *c*. Worm shaft and noncircular gear shaft form crossing angle  $\gamma_{w2}$  (see Fig. 6.3.2(b)). Angle  $\gamma_{w2}$  is given as

$$\gamma_{w2} = \frac{\pi}{2} - \beta_c - \lambda_w \tag{6.3.24}$$

wherein  $\beta_c$  is the helix angle of the skew rack cutter and  $\lambda_w$  is the lead angle of the worm.

For the purpose of simplicity, worm-thread surface may be considered as a surface with two independent parameters  $(h_w, \nu_w)$ .

**GENERATION OF SURFACE**  $\Sigma_2$  **OF NONCIRCULAR GEAR BY WORM.** The derivation of  $\Sigma_2$  by a worm-thread surface  $\Sigma_w$  is based on the following procedure (see Fig. 6.3.3):

- (i) Two coordinate systems  $S_w$  and  $S_2$  are considered rigidly connected to the worm-thread surface and the to-be-determined gear tooth surface. A fixed reference system  $S_f$  is considered for definition of motions of systems  $S_w$  and  $S_2$ .
- (ii) Worm-thread surface  $\Sigma_w$  is considered as given by vector  $\mathbf{R}_w(h_w, \nu_w)$ .
- (iii) Two sets of motions are provided to the worm:
  - (a) Rotation  $\phi_w$  about axis  $z_w$  of the worm.
  - (b) Translation  $s_w$  along axis  $z_f$  that is parallel to the axis of the gear. Coordinate system  $S_s$  is a movable coordinate system that is translated with system  $S_w$ .
- (iv) Rotation and translation of the worm are accompanied by rotation and translation of the elliptical gear as follows:
  - (a) Rotation  $\psi_2$  about axis  $z_2$  of the gear.
  - (b) Translation defined by position  $y_f^{(O_2)}$  along axis  $y_f$ .

Magnitudes  $\psi_2$  and  $y_f^{(O_2)}$  may be determined as functions of polar angle  $\theta_2$  of the noncircular gear as

$$y_f^{(O_2)}(\theta_2) = r(\theta_2)\sin\mu_2(\theta_2)$$
 (6.3.25)

$$\psi_2(\theta_2) = \theta_2 + \mu_2(\theta_2) - \mu_{20}, \qquad \mu_{20} = \frac{\pi}{2}$$
 (6.3.26)

Because  $r(\theta_2)$ ,  $\theta_2$ , and  $\mu_2$  are related with polar angle  $\theta_1$  of the eccentric gear by functions

$$r(\theta_2) = E_{12} - r(\theta_1) = E_{12} - \rho_1 \left( \sqrt{1 - \varepsilon_1^2 \sin^2 \theta_1} - \varepsilon_1 \cos \theta_1 \right)$$
 (6.3.27)

$$\theta_2 = \int_0^{\theta_1} \left( \frac{c_1}{c_1 - \sqrt{1 - \varepsilon_1^2 \sin^2 \theta_1} + \varepsilon_1 \cos \theta_1} - 1 \right) d\theta_1$$
 (6.3.28)

$$\mu_2(\theta_1) = \arctan\left(\frac{\sqrt{1 - \varepsilon_1^2 \sin^2 \theta_1}}{-\varepsilon_1 \sin \theta_1}\right),$$
(6.3.29)

a new function  $g(\phi_w, s_w, \theta_1) = 0$  must be determined to relate  $\phi_w$  and  $s_w$  with polar angle  $\theta_1$ .

#### (vi) Equations of meshing

<span id="page-125-0"></span>
$$f_1^{(w2)}(h_w, \nu_w, \phi_w, s_w) = 0 (6.3.31)$$

<span id="page-125-1"></span>
$$f_2^{(w2)}(h_w, \nu_w, \phi_w, s_w) = 0 (6.3.32)$$

relate parameters  $(h_w, \nu_w, \phi_w, s_w)$ . Simultaneous consideration of Eqs. (6.3.30), (6.3.31), and (6.3.32) determines surface  $\Sigma_2$  of noncircular gear.

**DERIVATION OF FUNCTION**  $g(\phi_w, s_w, \theta_1) = 0$ . The derivation is performed as follows (see Fig. 6.3.4):

(i) An imaginary rack cutter is considered in simultaneous meshing with the non-circular gear and the worm. At the initial position, system  $S_c$  coincides with

system  $S_f$ , and common tangent line t-t between the three surfaces,  $\Sigma_w$ ,  $\Sigma_2$ , and  $\Sigma_c$ , is at position  $t_0$ .

- (ii) Due to rotation and translation of the worm on  $\phi_w$  and  $s_w$ , the common tangent t-t will take position  $t_2$ . The location of system  $S_c$  in  $S_f$  is determined by  $x_f^{(O_c)}$ .
- (iii) Displacement of system  $S_c$  may be obtained as the sum of independent displacements  $\Delta x_{f_1}^{(O_c)}$  and  $\Delta x_{f_2}^{(O_c)}$ :

$$\Delta x_f^{(O_c)} = \Delta x_{f1}^{(O_c)} + \Delta x_{f2}^{(O_c)}$$
 (6.3.33)

Displacement  $\Delta x_{f1}^{(O_c)} = \overline{O_f S}$  is caused by translation  $s_w$  and is defined by positions  $t_0$  and  $t_1$ . Displacement  $\Delta x_{f2}^{(O_c)} = \overline{SO_c}$  is a result of rotation  $\phi_w$  and is defined by positions  $t_1$  and  $t_2$ .

(iv) Illustrations of Fig. 6.3.4(b) yield

$$-\Delta x_{f1}^{(O_c)} = \overline{O_f S} = \tan \beta_c s_w \tag{6.3.34}$$

$$-\Delta x_{f2}^{(O_c)} = \overline{SO_C} = \frac{p_w \cos \lambda_w}{\cos \beta_c} \phi_w \tag{6.3.35}$$

where  $p_w$  is the pitch of the worm.

(v) Because  $x_f^{(O_c)}$  depends on polar angle  $\theta_1$  as

$$x_f^{(O_c)} = -s(\theta_2) + r(\theta_2)\cos\mu_2(\theta_2)$$
 (6.3.36)

wherein

$$s(\theta_2) = \rho_1 \left( \theta_1 - \arcsin(\varepsilon_1 \sin \theta_1) \right) \tag{6.3.37}$$

$$r(\theta_2) = E_{12} - \rho_1 \left( \sqrt{1 - \varepsilon_1^2 \sin^2 \theta_1} - \varepsilon_1 \cos \theta_1 \right)$$
 (6.3.38)

$$\mu_2(\theta_2) = \arctan\left(\frac{\sqrt{1 - \varepsilon_1^2 \sin^2 \theta_1}}{-\varepsilon_1 \sin \theta_1}\right) \tag{6.3.39}$$

function  $g(\phi_w, s_w, \theta_1) = 0$  is obtained finally as

$$g(\phi_w, s_w, \theta_1) = x_f^{(O_c)}(\theta_1) + \tan \beta_c s_w + \frac{p_w \cos \lambda_w}{\cos \beta_c} \phi_w = 0$$
 (6.3.40)

COORDINATE TRANSFORMATION IN TRANSITION FROM COORDINATE SYSTEM  $s_w$  TO  $s_2$ . Derivation of Eq. (6.3.30) is performed as

$$\mathbf{r}_2(h_w, \nu_w, \phi_w, s_w) = \mathbf{M}_{2f}(\phi_w, s_w) \mathbf{M}_{fs}(s_w) \mathbf{M}_{sw}(\phi_w) \mathbf{R}_w(h_w, \nu_w)$$
(6.3.41)

Here,

$$\mathbf{M}_{2f} = \begin{bmatrix} -\cos\psi_2 & \sin\psi_2 & 0 & y_f^{(O_2)}\sin\psi_2 \\ -\sin\psi_2 & -\cos\psi_2 & 0 & -y_f^{(O_2)}\cos\psi_2 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix},$$

<span id="page-127-0"></span>

**MATRIX DERIVATION OF EQUATIONS OF MESHING.** Matrix derivation of equations of meshing  $f_1^{(w2)}(h_w, v_w, \phi_w, s_w) = 0$  and  $f_2^{(w2)}(h_w, v_w, \phi_w, s_w) = 0$  is applied as follows:

#### 6.4 Generation of the Eccentric Gear Providing Localized Contact

Localization of bearing contact is achieved by double-crowning of the eccentric circular gear. Application of a grinding disk or a grinding worm may be applied as described in detail in Litvin and Fuentes (Litvin & Fuentes, 2004). A parabolic coefficient  $a_{pc}$  is applied for profile crowning whereas a parabolic coefficient  $a_{pl}$  is applied for longitudinal crowning of the eccentric gear-tooth surface.

**TOOTH CONTACT ANALYSIS.** The eccentric gear-tooth surface  $\Sigma_1$  and the noncircular gear-tooth surface  $\Sigma_2$  have been previously obtained in their own rigidly connected reference systems  $S_1$  and  $S_2$ , respectively. A fixed reference system  $S_f$  is considered for investigation of tooth contact along the cycle of meshing. The algorithm of tooth contact analysis must be applied for each single pair of teeth.

The path of contact and function of transmission errors have been investigated for an eccentric gear with design parameters shown in Table 6.4.1.

Figure 6.4.1 shows paths of contact on tooth number 1 and 11 for various values of shaft angle error. Figure 6.4.2 shows the transmission function along a whole

#### **7.1 Introduction**

In this chapter, we consider the design of a gear drive formed by an external gear 1 and an internal noncircular gear 2. Henceforth, we assume that gear 1 is the driving one. Such a gear drive is called *internal noncircular gear drive* for the purpose of abbreviation.

The mentioned gear drive may be applied for variation of output speed of a gear mechanism and for function generation. The rotation of gears 1 and 2 of the drive are performed in the same direction, as shown in Fig. [7.1.1.](#page-133-2)

We may consider two cases of transformation of rotation by: (i) a pair of conjugated centrodes that form a pair of conjugated frictional disks, an *external* one (that is the smaller disk 1) and *internal* one (that is the larger disk 2); and (ii) a pair of gears, external 1 and internal 2. The frictional disks (and the gear centrodes 1 and 2) are in internal tangency.

#### **7.2 Derivation of Centrodes**

#### **7.2.1 Preliminary Considerations of Kinematics of Internal Gear Drive**

Figure [7.1.1\(](#page-133-2)a) shows schematically that external gear 1 (centrode 1) and internal gear 2 (centrode 2) perform rotation about centers *O*<sup>1</sup> and *O*<sup>2</sup> in the same direction. Rotation about center *O*<sup>1</sup> of external gear 1 is represented by vector *ω*(1)(φ1). Similarly, rotation about center *O*<sup>2</sup> of internal gear 2 is represented by vector *ω*(2)(φ1). Here, φ<sup>1</sup> represents the angle of rotation of external gear 1 about center *O*1.

The derivative function *m*12(φ1) is represented as

$$m_{12}(\phi_1) = \frac{\omega^{(1)}(\phi_1)}{\omega^{(2)}(\phi_1)} > 1$$
 (7.2.1)

The relative angular velocity is

$$\omega^{(12)}(\phi_1) = \omega^{(1)}(\phi_1) - \omega^{(2)}(\phi_1) = \omega^{(1)}(\phi_1) \left(1 - \frac{1}{m_{12}}\right)$$
 (7.2.2)

Illustration of transformation of rotation in case of internal noncircular gears: (a) *O*<sup>1</sup> and *O*<sup>2</sup> are the centers of rotation; (b) vectors *ω*(1) and *ω*(2) are directed along the respective axes of rotation.

wherein 
$$\left(1 - \frac{1}{m_{12}}\right) < 1$$
.

Application of internal gear drives allows the relative angular velocity ω(12)(φ1) and the relative velocity

$$\mathbf{v}^{(12)}(\phi_1) = \mathbf{v}^{(1)}(\phi_1) - \mathbf{v}^{(2)}(\phi_1)$$
 (7.2.3)

to be reduced. Reduction of relative velocity means reduction of sliding. This is the reason why internal gear drives are applied as gear drives with greater efficiency.

#### **7.2.2 Basic Equations of Centrodes**

The derivation of centrodes is based on the concept similar to the one applied in Chapter 2. The centrodes of the internal gear drive are in tangency at point *I* that belongs to the extended line *O*<sup>1</sup> − *O*<sup>2</sup> (Fig. [7.2.1\)](#page-133-3), wherein

$$\mathbf{v}^{(12)} = \mathbf{0}, \quad \mathbf{v}^{(1)} = \mathbf{v}^{(2)}$$
 (7.2.4)

<span id="page-134-1"></span>![](_page_134_Picture_2.jpeg)

Figure 7.2.1. Illustration of mating centrodes 1 and 2, polar axes  $\overline{O_i A_i}$  (i = 1, 2), rotation angles  $\phi_i$  (i = 1, 2), polar angles  $\theta_i$  (i = 1, 2), and polar vectors  $r_i$  (i = 1, 2).

Equation  $\mathbf{v}^{(12)} = \mathbf{0}$  means that the centrodes of the internal gear drive roll over each other and the sliding velocity of I is zero. Point I is the instantaneous center of rotation of the centrodes in relative motion.

Considering as given the derivative function  $m_{12}(\phi_1)$ , and taking into account that  $\mathbf{v}^{(12)} = \mathbf{0}$ , we obtain

<span id="page-134-0"></span>
$$m_{12}(\phi_1) = \frac{\omega^{(1)}(\phi_1)}{\omega^{(2)}(\phi_1)} = \frac{d\phi_1}{d\phi_2} = \frac{r_2(\phi_1)}{r_1(\phi_1)} = \frac{E + r_1(\phi_1)}{r_1(\phi_1)}$$
(7.2.5)

Equation (7.2.5) allows the conjugated centrodes  $\sigma_1$  and  $\sigma_2$  to be derived and represented as functions of angle  $\phi_1$ , where  $\phi_1$  is the angle of rotation of the driving centrode  $\sigma_1$ .

We may represent  $\sigma_1$  and  $\sigma_2$  as polar curves in terms of polar centrode angle  $\theta_1$ , taking into account that  $\theta_1 \equiv \phi_1$ , but  $\theta_1$  is measured opposite to  $\phi_1$ :

#### (i) Centrode $\sigma_1$ is represented as

$$r_1(\phi_1) = E \frac{1}{m_{12}(\phi_1) - 1} \tag{7.2.6}$$

or as

$$r_1(\theta_1) = E \frac{1}{m_{12}(\theta_1) - 1} \tag{7.2.7}$$

<span id="page-135-4"></span><span id="page-135-3"></span><span id="page-135-1"></span><span id="page-135-0"></span>(ii) Centrode σ<sup>2</sup> is represented as

$$r_2(\phi_1) = E \frac{m_{12}(\phi_1)}{m_{12}(\phi_1) - 1}$$
 (7.2.8)

$$\phi_2(\phi_1) = \int_0^{\phi_1} \frac{d\phi_1}{m_{12}(\phi_1)} \tag{7.2.9}$$

#### **7.2.3 Design of Centrodes** *σ***<sup>1</sup> and** *σ***<sup>2</sup> as Closed-Form Curves**

The conditions of centrodes σ<sup>1</sup> and σ<sup>2</sup> of an internal noncircular gear drive to be closed-form curves are similar to those discussed in Section [2.6](#page-41-5) for an external gear drive.

We require for an internal gear drive observation of the following conditions:

- (i) The derivative function *m*12(φ1) must be a periodic function with period *T* = *T*1/*n*1, where *T*<sup>1</sup> is the period of revolution of driving centrode σ<sup>1</sup> (gear 1) and *n*<sup>1</sup> is an integer number.
- (ii) The ratio between the revolutions *n*<sup>1</sup> and *n*<sup>2</sup> of centrodes 1 and 2, respectively, must be

$$\frac{T_1}{n_1} = \frac{T_2}{n_2} \tag{7.2.10}$$

where *n*<sup>1</sup> and *n*<sup>2</sup> are integer numbers.

(iii) The gear center distance *E* must be determined as a function of *n*<sup>1</sup> and *n*2.

Derivations similar to those performed in Section [2.6](#page-41-5) yield the following equation of *E* for an internal noncircular gear drive:

<span id="page-135-2"></span>
$$\frac{2\pi}{n_2} = \int_0^{\frac{2\pi}{n_1}} \frac{r_1(\phi_1)}{E + r_1(\phi_1)} d\phi_1 \tag{7.2.11}$$

where *r*1(φ1) is the known polar equation of driving centrode σ1.

Generally, the solution of Eq. [\(7.2.11\)](#page-135-2) for *E* may be obtained numerically and is an iterative process. An analytical solution of [\(7.2.11\)](#page-135-2) is obtained for a gear drive with elliptical and modified elliptical centrodes (see following).

#### **7.3 Examples of Design of Internal Noncircular Gear Drives**

#### **7.3.1 Gear Drive with Elliptical Pinion**

**Step 1.** Centrode σ<sup>1</sup> of the drive is represented in polar form (see Section [4.3.2\)](#page-62-4) as

$$r_1(\phi_1) = \frac{a(1 - e^2)}{1 - e\cos\phi_1}, \quad 0 \le \phi_1 \le 2\pi$$
 (7.3.1)

<span id="page-136-5"></span>**Step 2.** The derivative function of the drive,  $m_{21}(\phi_1) = \frac{1}{m_{12}(\phi_1)}$ , is represented (see Eq. (7.2.5)) as

$$m_{21}(\phi_1) = \frac{r_1(\phi_1)}{E + r_1(\phi_1)} = \frac{p}{E + p - Ee\cos\phi_1}$$
 (7.3.2)

where  $p = a(1 - e^2)$ .

**Step 3.** The next step is determination of center distance E = E(a, e, n). It is based on application of

<span id="page-136-0"></span>
$$\frac{2\pi}{n} = \int_0^{2\pi} m_{21}(\phi_1) d\phi_1 = \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{p}{E + p - Ee \cos \phi_1} d\phi_1$$
 (7.3.3)

The meaning of this equation is the requirement that the pinion (centrode  $\sigma_1$ ) will perform n revolutions for one revolution of gear 2.

Simple transformation of Eq. (7.3.3) yields

<span id="page-136-1"></span>
$$\frac{\pi}{n} = \frac{p}{E+p} \int_0^{\pi} \frac{d\phi_1}{1 - q\cos\phi_1}$$
 (7.3.4)

where  $q = \frac{Ee}{E+p}$ .

It follows from the tables of integrals (see Dwight, 1961, Problem 858.524), that

<span id="page-136-2"></span>
$$\int_0^{\pi} \frac{d\phi_1}{1 - q\cos\phi_1} = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{1 - q^2}}$$
 (7.3.5)

Equations (7.3.4) and (7.3.5) yield the following solution for E:

<span id="page-136-3"></span>
$$E(a, e, n) = a[-1 + \sqrt{1 + (n^2 - 1)(1 - e^2)}]$$
 (7.3.6)

It is remarkable, as shown later, that Eq. (7.3.6) works as well for determination of the center distance of a gear drive with modified elliptical or oval pinion.

**Step 4.** Centrode  $\sigma_2$  of gear 2 is represented as

<span id="page-136-4"></span>
$$r_2(\phi_1) = E + r_1(\phi_1) \tag{7.3.7}$$

$$\phi_2(\phi_1) = \int_0^{\phi_1} m_{21} d\phi_1 = \frac{p}{E+p} \int_0^{\phi_1} \frac{d\phi_1}{1-q\cos\phi_1}$$
 (7.3.8)

Transmission function  $\phi_2(\phi_1)$  may be determined numerically by integration of Eq. (7.3.8), or analytically (see Dwight, 1961, Problem 446.00) using

$$\int \frac{d\phi_1}{1 - q\cos\phi_1} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{1 - q^2}} \arctan\frac{1 + q\tan\frac{\phi_1}{2}}{\sqrt{1 - q^2}}$$
(7.3.9)

Figures 7.3.1(a) and (b) show the gear drives with elliptical pinion determined for n = 2 and n = 3, respectively; a = 39.3378 mm, e = 0.5.

#### 7.3.2 Gear Drive with Modified Elliptical Pinion

**Step 1.** The modified elliptical centrode  $\sigma_1$  of gear 1 (see Section 4.3.4) consists of two branches, the upper and the lower, and is represented by

<span id="page-137-2"></span>
$$r_1^{(I)}(\phi_1) = \frac{a(1 - e^2)}{1 - e\cos(m_I \phi_1)}, \quad 0 \le \phi_1 \le \pi/m_I$$
 (7.3.10)

$$r_1^{(II)}(\phi_1) = \frac{a(1-e^2)}{1-e\cos[m_{II}(2\pi-\phi_1)]}, \quad \pi/m_I \le \phi_1 \le 2\pi$$
 (7.3.11)

where  $m_{II} = \frac{m_I}{2m_I - 1}$  (see Eq. (4.3.35)).

**Step 2.** The derivative function of the drive,  $m_{21}(\phi_1)$ , is determined as

<span id="page-137-4"></span><span id="page-137-3"></span>
$$m_{21}(\phi_1) = \frac{\omega^{(2)}}{\omega^{(1)}} = \frac{r_1(\phi_1)}{r_2(\phi_1)} = \frac{r_1(\phi_1)}{E + r_1(\phi_1)}$$
 (7.3.12)

Equations (7.3.10), (7.3.11), and (7.3.12) yield

<span id="page-137-6"></span><span id="page-137-5"></span>
$$m_{21}^{(I)}(\phi_1) = \frac{p}{p + E - Ee\cos(m_I\phi_1)}, \quad 0 \le \phi_1 \le \frac{\pi}{m_I}$$
 (7.3.13)

$$m_{21}^{(II)}(\phi_1) = \frac{p}{p + E - Ee\cos(m_{II}(2\pi - \phi_1))}, \quad \frac{\pi}{m_I} \le \phi_1 \le 2\pi \quad (7.3.14)$$

<span id="page-138-3"></span><span id="page-138-1"></span><span id="page-138-0"></span>**Step 3.** Gear 1 (centrode  $\sigma_1$ ) performs n revolutions for one revolution of gear 2, and therefore

<span id="page-138-2"></span>
$$\frac{2\pi}{n} = \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{m_I}} m_{21}^{(I)} d\phi_1 + \int_{\frac{\pi}{m_I}}^{2\pi} m_{21}^{(II)} d\phi_1$$
 (7.3.15)

We recall that centrodes  $\sigma_1$  and  $\sigma_2$  are closed curves and n is an integer number.

**Step 4.** We apply Eqs. (7.3.13), (7.3.14), and (7.3.15) for determination of E = E(a, e, n). The derivation of E is based on the following procedure:

(i) The variables of the integrals of Eq. (7.3.15) are changed as

$$m_I \phi_1 = x, \quad m_{II}(2\pi - \phi_1) = y$$
 (7.3.16)

(ii) We take into account that (see Dwight, 1961, Problem 858.524)

$$\int_0^{\pi} \frac{dx}{1 - q \cos x} = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{1 - q^2}}, \quad \int_0^{\pi} \frac{dy}{1 - \mu \cos y} = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{1 - \mu^2}}$$
 (7.3.17)

We then obtain the solution E = E(a, e, n) for the drive with modified elliptical gears that is the same as for the drive with conventional ellipses represented by Eq. (7.3.6).

**Step 5.** Centrode  $\sigma_2$  is represented by

$$r_2^{(I)}(\phi_1) = E + r_1^{(I)}(\phi_1)$$
 (7.3.18)

$$\phi_2^{(I)}(\phi_1) = \int_0^{\phi_1} m_{21}^{(I)}(\phi_1) d\theta_1, \quad 0 \le \phi_1 \le \frac{\pi}{m_I}$$
 (7.3.19)

Similarly, we represent equations for  $r_2^{(II)}(\phi_1)$  and  $\phi_2^{(II)}(\phi_1)$ .

Determination of  $\phi_2^{(i)}(\phi_1)$ , (i=I,II), may be obtained by using the expression for independent integral  $\int \frac{dx}{1-q\cos x}$  (see Dwight, 1961, Problem 446.00).

Figure 7.3.2 illustrates designed internal gear drives with modified elliptical gears.

#### 7.3.3 Gear Drive with Oval Pinion

**Step 1.** The centrode  $\sigma_1$  of the pinion is an oval (see Fig. 7.3.3), a curve obtained as the result of transformation of a conventional ellipse performed as follows: (i) the magnitude of the radius vector of the ellipse is observed, but (ii) the position angle is increased twice.

The polar equation of the oval gear 1 is represented as

$$r_1(\phi_1) = \frac{a(1 - e^2)}{1 - e\cos 2\phi_1}, \quad 0 \le \phi_1 \le 2\pi$$
 (7.3.20)

wherein a and e are the semi-length of the major axis and the eccentricity of the ellipse being transformed.

<span id="page-140-2"></span>
$$m_{21}(\phi_1) = \frac{r_1(\phi_1)}{E + r_1(\phi_1)} = \frac{p}{E + p - Ee\cos 2\phi_1}$$
 (7.3.21)

**Step 3.** Relation between rotations of gears 1 and 2. This relation is similar to the one that has been represented for an external gear drive (see Section 4.3.5.3):

$$2\pi = n \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{p}{E + p - Ee \cos 2\phi_1} d\phi_1 = \left(\frac{np}{E + p}\right) \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{d\phi_1}{1 - \left(\frac{Ee}{E + p}\right) \cos 2\phi_1}$$
(7.3.22)

**Step 4.** Derivation of center distance E. The variable  $\phi_1$  is changed for x wherein

$$2\phi_1 = x, \quad d\phi_1 = \frac{dx}{2} \tag{7.3.23}$$

that yields

$$2\pi = \left(\frac{np}{E+p}\right) \left(\frac{4}{2}\right) \int_0^{\pi} \frac{dx}{1 - q\cos x}, \quad q = \frac{Ee}{E+p}$$
 (7.3.24)

From tables of integrals (Dwight, 1961),

$$\int_0^{\pi} \frac{dx}{1 - q\cos x} = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{1 - q^2}} \tag{7.3.25}$$

After simple derivations, we obtain equation E = E(a, e, n) that is the same as Eq. (7.3.6) represented for internal noncircular gear drives with elliptical pinion and modified elliptical pinion.

**Step 5.** Centrode  $\sigma_2$  of internal gear is determined with

<span id="page-140-3"></span>
$$r_2(\phi_1) = E + r_1(\phi_1) \tag{7.3.26}$$

$$\phi_2 = \int_0^{\phi_1} m_{21}(\phi_1) d\phi_1 \tag{7.3.27}$$

where  $m_{21}(\phi_1)$  is represented by Eq. (7.3.21).

Transmission function  $\phi_2(\phi_1)$  may be determined by numerical integration of Eq. (7.3.27), and analytically using the work of Dwight (Dwight, 1961, see Problem 446.00), with  $a^2 > b^2$ .

Centrodes  $\sigma_1$  and  $\sigma_2$  of the drive are illustrated by Fig. 7.3.3.

#### 7.3.4 Gear Drive with Eccentric Pinion

**Step 1.** Derivation of  $r_1(\phi_1) = |\overline{O_1M}|$ . Centrode  $\sigma_1$  of gear 1 is an eccentric circle of radius a and eccentricity  $e = |\overline{O_1C_1}| = |\overline{O_1C_2}|$  (Fig. 7.3.4). Centrode  $\sigma_1$  (the eccentric circle) performs rotation about center  $O_1$  and is shown in two positions: the initial one, and the current one after rotation on angle  $\phi_1$ .

<span id="page-141-1"></span><span id="page-141-0"></span>The conjugated centrode  $\sigma_2$  (not shown in Fig. 7.3.4) is an internal curve and performs rotation about center  $O_2$ ;  $E = |\overline{O_2 O_1}|$  is the shortest center distance.

Centrodes  $\sigma_1$  and  $\sigma_2$  are in tangency at a point M that belongs to the extended line  $O_1 - O_2$ . Current point M of tangency of centrodes moves along  $O_1 - O_2$  in the process of rotation. It follows from the drawings that

$$r_1(\phi_1) = |\overline{O_1 M}| = (a^2 - e^2 \sin^2 \phi_1)^{0.5} - e \cos \phi_1, \quad 0 \le \phi_1 \le 2\pi$$
 (7.3.28)

**Step 2.** Derivative function  $m_{21}(\phi_1)$ . The derivative function  $m_{21}(\phi_1)$  is determined as

$$m_{21}(\phi_1) = \frac{d\phi_2}{d\phi_1} = \frac{r_1(\phi_1)}{r_2(\phi_2)} = \frac{r_1(\phi_1)}{E + r_1(\phi_1)}$$
$$= 1 - \frac{c}{c + (1 - \varepsilon^2 \sin^2 \phi_1)^{0.5} - \varepsilon \cos \phi_1}$$
(7.3.29)

where  $c = \frac{E}{a}$  and  $\varepsilon = \frac{e}{a}$ .

**Step 3.** Derivation of c = E/a. Centrode  $\sigma_2$  (of internal gear) must be a closed-form curve, and this may be obtained by the observation of

<span id="page-141-3"></span><span id="page-141-2"></span>
$$\frac{2\pi}{n} = \int_0^{2\pi} \left( 1 - \frac{c}{c + (1 - \varepsilon^2 \sin^2 \phi_1)^{0.5} - \varepsilon \cos \phi_1} \right) d\phi_1 \tag{7.3.30}$$

The meaning of Eq. (7.3.30) is that centrode  $\sigma_1$  (of the pinion) performs n revolutions for one revolution of centrode  $\sigma_2$  of internal gear; n is an integer number.

+ \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\pi}^{2\pi} \frac{c}{c + (1 - \varepsilon^2 \sin^2 \phi_1)^{0.5} - \varepsilon \cos \phi_1} d\phi_1 
= \frac{1}{\pi} \int_0^{\pi} \frac{c}{c + (1 - \varepsilon^2 \sin^2 \phi_1)^{0.5} - \varepsilon \cos \phi_1} d\phi_1$$
(7.3.31)

**Step 4.** Derivation of centrode  $\sigma_2$ . The centrode  $\sigma_2$  is represented by

$$r_{2}(\phi_{1}) = E + r_{1}(\phi_{1})$$

$$\phi_{2}(\phi_{1}) = \int_{0}^{\phi_{1}} m_{21}(\phi_{1}) d\phi_{1}$$

$$= \phi_{1} - \int_{0}^{\phi_{1}} \frac{E}{E + (a^{2} - e^{2} \sin^{2} \phi_{1})^{0.5} - e \cos \phi_{1}} d\phi_{1}, \quad 0 \leq \phi_{1} \leq 2\pi n$$

#### <span id="page-143-2"></span>7.4 Generation of Planar Internal Noncircular Gears by Shaper

Generation of pinion 1 with centrode  $\sigma_1$  of the internal gear drive may be performed by a rack cutter, a shaper, or a hob (see Chapter 5).

The generation of internal noncircular gear 2 with centrode  $\sigma_2$  must be performed by a shaper s. The generated profile  $\Gamma_2$  of gear 2 is determined as the envelope to the family of profiles  $\Gamma_s$  of the shaper in relative motion of  $\Gamma_s$  with respect to  $\Gamma_2$ . The conjugation of pinion 1 and gear 2 is provided by considering simultaneous tangency of centrodes of 1, 2, and shaper s (Fig. 7.4.1).

The generation of  $\Gamma_2$  by  $\Gamma_s$  may be accompanied by undercutting that is a defect of meshing of  $\Gamma_2$  and  $\Gamma_s$ . Such a defect is the result of *interference* of  $\Gamma_s$  in the space of  $\Gamma_2$ . Design of shaper s with a larger pressure angle  $\alpha_s$  is in favor of avoidance of undercutting, but proper geometric relations between  $\Gamma_s$ ,  $\Gamma_2$ , and  $\Gamma_1$  are preferable.

Henceforth, we will consider the following cases of tangency of rolling centrodes: (i) tangency of centrodes  $\sigma_1$ ,  $\sigma_2$ , and  $\sigma_s$  (Fig. 7.4.1), and (ii) tangency of centrodes  $\sigma_2$  and  $\sigma_s$  (Fig. 7.4.2).

**TANGENCY OF CENTRODES**  $\sigma_1$ ,  $\sigma_2$ , AND  $\sigma_s$ . Figure 7.4.1(a) shows that the centrodes are initially in tangency at common point  $I_o^{(\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_s)}$ . Three movable coordinate systems  $S_1$ ,  $S_2$ , and  $S_s$  are considered that are rigidly connected to pinion 1, internal gear 2, and shaper s. Coordinate systems  $S_1$  and  $S_2$  perform related rotations about  $O_1$  and  $O_2$ , respectively (Fig. 7.4.1); points  $I_o^{(\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_s)}$  and  $I^{(\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_s)}$  are the initial and current positions of centrodes tangency (Figs. 7.4.1(a) and (b)) and they are the instantaneous centers of rotation of centrodes in relative motion.

Point  $I^{(\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_s)}$  of tangency of centrodes  $\sigma_1$  and  $\sigma_2$  moves in the process of motion along line  $O_2 - O_1 - I^{(\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_s)}$  (Fig. 7.4.1). Tangency of  $\sigma_s$  with  $\sigma_1$  and  $\sigma_2$  at

point *I*(σ1,σ2,σ*s*) is obtained wherein shaper *s* performs a complex motion: (a) translational motion with coordinate system *Ss*, and (b) rotational motion about *Os*; *O*(*o*) *<sup>s</sup>* and *Os* are the initial and current positions of the origin of *Ss* (Fig. [7.4.1\(](#page-133-2)b)). Coordinate system *Sf* is the fixed one.

Centrodes σ1, σ2, and σ*<sup>s</sup>* roll over each other in the process of transformation of motion. The common normal to profiles 1, 2, and *<sup>s</sup>* (not shown in Fig. [7.4.1\)](#page-133-2) passes through the point of tangency *I*(σ1,σ2,σ*s*) of the three centrodes, and this is the condition of conjugation of profiles 1, 2, and *s*.

**TANGENCY OF CENTRODES** *σ***<sup>2</sup> AND** *σs***.** Shaper *s* with profile *<sup>s</sup>* generates profile <sup>2</sup> of internal gear 2 wherein coordinate systems *Ss* and *S*<sup>2</sup> are rigidly connected to *s* and 2. We apply the following coordinate systems (Fig. [7.4.2\)](#page-144-1):

- (i) Coordinate system *Ss*, that is rigidly connected to *s* and performs rotation about *Os* on angle ψ*s*;
- (ii) Coordinate system *S*2, that is rigidly connected to gear 2 and performs (a) translational motion with auxiliary coordinate system *Sn* (Fig. [7.4.2\)](#page-144-1), and (b) rotational motion about origin *On* of *Sn* on angle ψ<sup>2</sup> (Fig. [7.4.2\)](#page-144-1).

<span id="page-145-4"></span>The translational motions of  $S_n$  and  $S_2$  are performed collinear to axes  $(x_f, y_f)$ . Figure 7.4.2 shows the current point  $I^{(\sigma_2,\sigma_s)}$  of tangency of centrodes  $\sigma_2$  and  $\sigma_s$ . Initially, centrodes  $\sigma_2$  and  $\sigma_s$  were in tangency at point  $I_o^{(\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_s)}$  (Fig. 7.4.1(a)). Then,  $\sigma_2$  and  $\sigma_s$  become in tangency at point  $I^{(\sigma_2,\sigma_s)}$  (Fig. 7.4.2), and their common tangent forms angle  $\mu_2$  with radius vector  $\overline{O_2I}$  of centrode 2 and is perpendicular to  $\overline{O_sI}$ .

Tangency of  $\sigma_2$  and  $\sigma_s$  at  $I^{(\sigma_2,\sigma_s)}$  is provided, if centrode  $\sigma_2$  with coordinate system  $S_n$  is translated on magnitudes  $x_f^{(O_2)}$  and  $E_{s2,0}+y_f^{(O_2)}$  along axes  $(x_f,y_f)$  of  $S_f$ . Notice that the magnitude of  $y_f^{(O_2)}$  expressed in  $S_f$  will be negative. Here,  $E_{s2,0}$  is the initial center distance between centrodes  $\sigma_2$  and  $\sigma_s$  (see Fig. 7.4.2); magnitudes  $x_f^{(O_2)}$  and  $y_f^{(O_2)}$  may be represented as functions of polar angle  $\theta_2$  as

<span id="page-145-1"></span>
$$x_f^{(O_2)} = -r_2(\theta_2)\cos\mu_2\tag{7.4.1}$$

$$y_f^{(O_2)} = +r_2(\theta_2)\sin\mu_2 + \rho_s \tag{7.4.2}$$

<span id="page-145-2"></span>
$$\psi_2 = \theta_2 + \mu_2 - \frac{\pi}{2} \tag{7.4.3}$$

Centrodes  $\sigma_s$  and  $\sigma_2$  will have a common normal at  $I^{(\sigma_2,\sigma_s)}$  that forms angle  $\mu_2$  with position vector  $\overline{O_2I}$  (see the notation of angle  $\mu$  in Section 2.5). The common tangent to  $\sigma_s$  and  $\sigma_2$  will pass through point  $I^{(\sigma_2,\sigma_s)}$  of tangency of  $\sigma_2$  and  $\sigma_s$ , and the relative velocity  $\mathbf{v}^{(s2)}$  will satisfy

<span id="page-145-0"></span>
$$\mathbf{v}^{(s2)} \cdot \mathbf{N}^{(s)} = \mathbf{v}^{(s2)} \cdot \mathbf{N}^{(2)} = 0$$
 (7.4.4)

where  $\mathbf{N}^{(s)}$  and  $\mathbf{N}^{(2)}$  are the normals to centrodes  $\sigma_s$  and  $\sigma_2$ .

Observation of Eq. (7.4.4) is the condition of derivation of the equation of meshing of shaper  $\sigma_s$  and internal gear 2.

**PROFILE**  $\Gamma_s$  **OF SHAPER s.** Figure 7.4.3 shows the generating involute profile  $\Gamma_s$  of the shaper teeth in coordinate system  $S_s$ . Involute profile of the shaper may be obtained as well considering the generating process of a spur gear by a rack cutter (Litvin & Fuentes, 2004). In matrix form, the involute profile is represented as

<span id="page-145-3"></span>
$$\mathbf{r}_{s}(\theta_{s}) = \begin{bmatrix} \rho_{bs} \left[ \sin(\theta_{s} - \theta_{0s}) - \theta_{s} \cos(\theta_{s} - \theta_{0s}) \right] \\ \rho_{bs} \left[ \cos(\theta_{s} - \theta_{0s}) + \theta_{s} \sin(\theta_{s} - \theta_{0s}) \right] \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$$
(7.4.5)

Here,  $\rho_{bs} = \rho_s \cos \alpha_s$  is the base radius of the shaper,  $\rho_s$  is its pitch radius, and  $\alpha_s$  is the pressure angle. Parameter  $\theta_{0s}$  for a standard involute shaper is determined as

$$\theta_{0s} = \frac{\pi m}{4\rho_s} + \text{inv}\alpha_s \tag{7.4.6}$$

$$\mathbf{n}_{s}(\theta_{s}) = \frac{\frac{d\mathbf{r}_{s}}{d\theta_{s}} \times \mathbf{k}}{\left| \frac{d\mathbf{r}_{s}}{d\theta_{s}} \right|}$$

**MATRIX DERIVATION OF PROFILE**  $\Gamma_2$  **OF INTERNAL GEAR 2.** Profile  $\Gamma_2$  is generated as the envelope to the family of generating profiles  $\Gamma_s$  determined in  $S_2$  by

(7.4.8)

Matrices  $\mathbf{M}_{2n}$ ,  $\mathbf{M}_{nf}$ , and  $\mathbf{M}_{fs}$  of Eq. (7.4.8) describe coordinate transformation from coordinate system  $S_s$  to coordinate system  $S_2$ . Here,

$$\mathbf{M}_{2n}(\psi_2) = \begin{bmatrix} \cos \psi_2 & \sin \psi_2 & 0 & 0 \\ -\sin \psi_2 & \cos \psi_2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$$

$$\mathbf{M}_{nf}(x_f^{(O_2)}, y_f^{(O_2)}) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & -x_f^{(O_2)} \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & -y_f^{(O_2)} \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$$

(7.4.11)

Matrix transformation Eq. (7.4.8) may be expressed by matrices ( $3 \times 3$ ) as

<span id="page-147-0"></span>
$$\rho_{2}(\theta_{s}, \theta_{2}) = \mathbf{L}_{2n} \mathbf{L}_{nf} \mathbf{L}_{fs} \rho_{s}(\theta_{s}) + \mathbf{R}$$

where  $\mathbf{R}$  is given by

$$\mathbf{R} = \begin{bmatrix} -x_f^{(O_2)} \cos \psi_2 - y_f^{(O_2)} \sin \psi_2 \\ x_f^{(O_2)} \sin \psi_2 - y_f^{(O_2)} \cos \psi_2 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$$
(7.4.13)

Profile  $\Gamma_2$  is determined by simultaneous consideration of Eq. (7.4.12) and the scalar product (see Litvin & Fuentes, 2004):

 (7.4.14)

Here,  $\mathbf{n}_s$  is the unit normal to the shaper and  $\mathbf{v}_2^{(s2)}$  is the relative velocity, which is represented in  $S_2$  by

$$\mathbf{v}_2^{(s2)} = \dot{\boldsymbol{\rho}}_2 = (\dot{\mathbf{L}}_{2n} \mathbf{L}_{nf} \mathbf{L}_{fs} + \mathbf{L}_{2n} \mathbf{L}_{nf} \dot{\mathbf{L}}_{fs}) \boldsymbol{\rho}_s + \dot{\mathbf{R}}$$

$$\dot{\mathbf{L}}_{fs} = \begin{bmatrix} -\sin\psi_s & -\cos\psi_s & 0\\ \cos\psi_s & -\sin\psi_s & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \dot{\psi}_s \tag{7.4.17}$$

$$\dot{\mathbf{R}} = \begin{bmatrix} -\dot{x}_f^{(O_2)} \cos \psi_2 - \dot{y}_f^{(O_2)} \sin \psi_2 + (x_f^{(O_2)} \sin \psi_2 - y_f^{(O_2)} \cos \psi_2) \dot{\psi}_2 \\ \dot{x}_f^{(O_2)} \sin \psi_2 - \dot{y}_f^{(O_2)} \cos \psi_2 + (x_f^{(O_2)} \cos \psi_2 + y_f^{(O_2)} \sin \psi_2) \dot{\psi}_2 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$$
(7.4.18)

Derivatives  $\dot{\psi}_2, \dot{\psi}_s, \dot{x}_f^{(O_2)}, \dot{y}_f^{(O_2)}$  are obtained as

$$\dot{\psi}_2 = \frac{d\psi_2}{d\theta_2}\dot{\theta}_2 = \left(1 + \frac{d\mu_2}{d\theta_2}\right)\dot{\theta}_2 \tag{7.4.19}$$

$$\dot{\psi}_s = \frac{d\psi_s}{d\theta_2}\dot{\theta}_2 = \frac{1}{\rho_s}\frac{ds(\theta_2)}{d\theta_2}\dot{\theta}_2 \tag{7.4.20}$$

$$\theta_2(\theta_1) = \int_0^{\theta_1} \frac{r_1(\theta_1)}{E + r_1(\theta_1)} d\theta_1 \tag{7.4.25}$$

Term  $\frac{d^2r_2}{d\theta_2^2}$  (which is needed for  $\frac{d\mu_2}{d\theta_2}$ ) is obtained by differentiation of Eq. (7.4.23) as

$$\frac{d^2r_2}{d\theta_2^2} = \frac{d^2r_1}{d\theta_1^2} \frac{(E+r_1)^2}{r_1^2} - \left(\frac{dr_1}{d\theta_1}\right)^2 \frac{E(E+r_1)}{r_1^3}$$
(7.4.26)

Term  $\mu_2$  is obtained as (see Eq. (2.5.1))

$$\mu_2 = \arctan \frac{r_2(\theta_2)}{\frac{dr_2}{d\theta_2}} \tag{7.4.27}$$

Term  $\frac{d\mu_2}{d\theta_2}$  is obtained as (see Eq. (2.8.4))

$$\frac{d\mu_2}{d\theta_2} = \cos^2 \mu_2 \left[ 1 - \frac{r_2(\theta_2) \frac{d^2 r_2}{d\theta_2^2}}{\left(\frac{dr_2}{d\theta_2}\right)^2} \right]$$

(7.4.29)

In all previous derivations, expressions  $r_1(\theta_1)$ ,  $\frac{dr_1(\theta_1)}{d\theta_1}$ , and  $\frac{d^2r_1(\theta_1)}{d\theta_1^2}$  are known and depend on the type of centrode (elliptical, eccentric, modified elliptical).

#### 7.5 Conditions of Nonundercutting of Planar Internal Noncircular Gears

Undercutting of profile  $\Gamma_2$  of planar internal noncircular gear tooth is caused by the interference with the profile of the tip of the profile  $\Gamma_s$  of the generating shaper during the relative motion between the shaper and the internal noncircular gear (see Fig. 7.5.1). The tip of profile  $\Gamma_s$  is represented by point M, which belongs to the addendum circle of the shaper.

<span id="page-150-4"></span><span id="page-150-3"></span><span id="page-150-1"></span><span id="page-150-0"></span>The limiting condition of undercutting corresponds to positions wherein the trajectory of point M reaches point K, which belongs to the addendum curve of the internal noncircular gear tooth profile. The trajectory of point M depends on the method of generation of the internal noncircular gear by the shaper. Here, *axial* generation is considered, which means that center distance between the shaper and the internal noncircular gear is modified according to expressions of  $x_f^{(O_2)}$  and  $y_f^{(O_2)}$  (see Eqs. (7.4.1) and (7.4.2)).

Two approaches are considered for determination of the limiting value of the pitch radius  $\rho_s^*$  of the shaper for avoidance of undercutting. In consequence, the limiting value of shaper teeth,  $N_s^*$ , is obtained as

$$N_s^* = \frac{2\rho_s^*}{m} \tag{7.5.1}$$

where m is the module of the gear drive.

#### 7.5.1 Approach A

The limiting condition of undercutting can be represented numerically by a set of nonlinear equations. Solution of such a set of nonlinear equations implies determination of the limiting value of the pitch radius  $\rho_s^*$ . The proposed approach is based on the following algorithm:

(1) Point M belongs to the addendum circle of the shaper, and this condition is represented by

$$f_1(\theta_s^M, \rho_s^*) = |\mathbf{r}_s^{(M)}(\theta_s^M, \rho_s^*)| - (\rho_s^* + 1.2m) = 0$$
 (7.5.2)

Here,  $|\mathbf{r}_s^{(M)}(\theta_s^M, \rho_s^*)| = \sqrt{(r_{sx}^M)^2 + (r_{sy}^M)^2}$ , and vector  $\mathbf{r}_s^{(M)}(\theta_s^M, \rho_s^*)$  is represented by Eq. (7.4.5) wherein  $\rho_s = \rho_s^*$  is considered as a variable.

(2) Point K belongs to the profile  $\Gamma_2$  of the noncircular gear tooth, and this condition implies that equation of meshing Eq. (7.4.14) is satisfied at point K,

$$f_2(\theta_s^K, \theta_2^K, \rho_s^*) = 0 (7.5.3)$$

(3) Point *K* belongs to the addendum curve of the noncircular gear, and this condition is represented by

$$f_3(\theta_s^K, \theta_2^K, \rho_s^*, \theta_{\sigma_2}^K) = |\mathbf{r}_2^{(K)}(\theta_s^K, \theta_2^K, \rho_s^*)| - (r_2(\theta_{\sigma_2}^K) - m) = 0$$
 (7.5.4)

Here

(i)  $|\mathbf{r}_{2}^{(K)}(\theta_{s}^{K}, \theta_{2}^{K}, \rho_{s}^{*})| = \sqrt{(r_{2x}^{K})^{2} + (r_{2y}^{K})^{2}}$  where vector  $\mathbf{r}_{2}^{(K)}(\theta_{s}^{K}, \theta_{2}^{K}, \rho_{s}^{*})$  is obtained by matrix transformation as

<span id="page-150-2"></span>
$$\mathbf{r}_{2}^{(K)}(\theta_{s}^{K}, \theta_{2}^{K}, \rho_{s}^{*}) = \mathbf{M}_{2s}(\theta_{2}^{K})\mathbf{r}_{s}(\theta_{s}^{K}, \rho_{s}^{*})$$
(7.5.5)

(ii)  $r_2(\theta_{\sigma_2}^K)$  is the amplitude of polar vector of the centrode  $\sigma_2$  corresponding to point K and  $\theta_{\sigma_2}^K$  is its polar angle.

<span id="page-151-1"></span><span id="page-151-0"></span>(4) Polar angle  $\theta_{\sigma_2}^K$  satisfies

$$f_4(\theta_s^K, \theta_2^K, \theta_{\sigma_2}^K, \rho_s^*) = \tan \theta_{\sigma_2}^K - \frac{r_{2x}^K(\theta_s^K, \theta_2^K, \rho_s^*)}{r_{2y}^K(\theta_s^K, \theta_2^K, \rho_s^*)} = 0$$
 (7.5.6)

(5) The trajectory of point M in coordinate system  $S_2$  may be obtained by application of matrix transformation

<span id="page-151-2"></span>
$$\mathbf{r}_{2}^{(M)}(\theta_{s}^{M}, \rho_{s}^{*}, \theta_{2}) = \mathbf{M}_{2s}(\theta_{2})\mathbf{r}_{s}(\theta_{s}^{M}, \rho_{s}^{*})$$
(7.5.7)

wherein  $\theta_2$  is the parameter of the curve that represents the trajectory of M.

(6) Intersection of curve represented by Eq. (7.5.7) and profile  $\Gamma_2$  at point K represented by Eq. (7.5.5) provides a vectorial equation

$$\mathbf{r}_{2}^{(M)}(\theta_{s}^{M}, \rho_{s}^{*}, \theta_{2}) - \mathbf{r}_{2}^{(K)}(\theta_{s}^{K}, \theta_{2}^{K}, \rho_{s}^{K}) = \mathbf{0}$$
(7.5.8)

that yields two additional scalar equations

$$f_5(\theta_s^M, \theta_s^K, \theta_2^K, \rho_s^*, \theta_2) = r_{2x}^M - r_{2x}^K = 0$$
 (7.5.9)

$$f_6(\theta_s^M, \theta_s^K, \theta_2^K, \rho_s^*, \theta_2) = r_{2y}^M - r_{2y}^K = 0$$
 (7.5.10)

(7) A system of six nonlinear equations  $f_1$ ,  $f_2$ ,  $f_3$ ,  $f_4$ ,  $f_5$ ,  $f_6$  is obtained as

$$f_1(\theta_s^M, \rho_s^*) = 0 (7.5.11)$$

$$f_2(\theta_s^K, \theta_2^K, \rho_s^*) = 0$$
 (7.5.12)

$$f_3(\theta_s^K, \theta_2^K, \rho_s^*, \theta_{\sigma_2}^K) = 0$$
 (7.5.13)

$$f_4(\theta_s^K, \theta_2^K, \theta_{\sigma_2}^K, \rho_s^K) = 0$$
 (7.5.14)

$$f_5(\theta_s^M, \theta_s^K, \theta_2^K, \rho_s^*, \theta_2) = 0$$
 (7.5.15)

$$f_6(\theta_s^M, \theta_s^K, \theta_2^K, \rho_s^*, \theta_2) = 0$$
 (7.5.16)

and may be solved numerically for determination of unknowns  $(\theta_s^M, \rho_s^*, \theta_s^K, \theta_2^K, \theta_{\sigma_s}^K, \theta_2^K)$ .

#### 7.5.2 Approach B

Approach B is based on the results provided in Table 7.5.1, developed by Litvin *et al.* (Litvin *et al.*, 1994), to determine the maximal number of teeth for various pressure angles in the case of internal circular involute gears (see Chapter 11 of Litvin & Fuentes, 2004).

Figure 7.5.2 shows the substitution of centrode  $\sigma_2$  of the internal noncircular gear by a new centrode  $\sigma_{2c}$  of a circular gear with pitch radius equal to the minimal radius of the centrode  $\sigma_2$ . Centrode  $\sigma_{2c}$  is rigidly connected to system  $S_{2c}$ . The trajectory of point M in system  $S_{2c}$  is an extended hypocycloid.

Approach B is based on the following algorithm:

(1) The minimal curvature radius of centrode  $\sigma_2$  of the internal noncircular gear,  $\rho_{2,min}$ , is obtained by consideration of (see Eq. (2.8.8))

$$\rho_2(\theta_2) = \frac{\left[r_2(\theta_2)^2 + \left(\frac{dr_2}{d\theta_2}\right)^2\right]^{3/2}}{r_2(\theta_2)^2 + 2\left(\frac{dr_2}{d\theta_2}\right)^2 - r_2(\theta_2)\frac{d^2r_2}{d\theta_2^2}}$$
(7.5.17)

$$\frac{d\rho_2}{d\theta_2} = 0\tag{7.5.18}$$

Expressions  $r_2(\theta_2)$ ,  $\frac{dr_2(\theta_2)}{d\theta_2}$ , and  $\frac{d^2r_2(\theta_2)}{d\theta_2^2}$  have been represented in Section 7.4.

(2) The number of teeth for the equivalent internal circular gear is obtained as

$$N_2^* = \frac{2\rho_{2,min}}{m} \tag{7.5.19}$$

(3) The limiting value of the number of shaper teeth can be obtained by application of Table 7.5.1 (see Chapter 11 of Litvin & Fuentes, 2004).

#### 7.5.3 Numerical Example

An internal noncircular gear drive based on a conventional elliptical pinion is considered. The gear data are shown in Table 7.5.2.

Parameter a of the elliptical centrode  $\sigma_1$  is obtained as (see Eq. (4.3.26))

$$a = \frac{N_1 m \pi}{4 \int_0^{\pi/2} \sqrt{1 - e^2 \sin^2 \theta_1} d\theta_1} = 62.631089 \,\text{mm}$$

<span id="page-154-0"></span>
$$E = a[-1 + \sqrt{1 + (n^2 - 1)(1 - e^2)}] = 60.737850 \,\mathrm{mm}$$

**APPLICATION OF APPROACH A.** The solution of the set of the nonlinear equations corresponding to the Approach A provides the values of magnitudes  $(\theta_s^M, \rho_s^*, \theta_s^K, \theta_2^K, \theta_2^K, \theta_2^K, \theta_2^K)$  shown in Table 7.5.3.

The limiting value of the number of shaper teeth is obtained as

$$N_s^* = \frac{2\rho_s^*}{m} = 41.2708$$

Figure 7.5.3 shows the trajectories of point M in two cases: for  $N_s = 41$  ( $\rho_s = 82$  mm) and for  $N_s = 42$  ( $\rho_s = 84$  mm). The detail A of Fig. 7.5.3 shows that undercutting occurs for  $N_s = 42$ , whereas undercutting does not occur for  $N_s = 41$ .

**APPLICATION OF APPROACH B.** The minimal radius of curvature of centrode  $\sigma_2$  is obtained at  $\theta_2 = 0$  (see Fig. 7.3.1(a)). In this case,

$$\rho_{2,min} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{E + a(1+e)} + \frac{e}{a(1-e^2)}} = 93.589402 \,\text{mm}$$

The number of teeth of the equivalent internal circular gear,  $N_2^*$ , is obtained as

$$N_2^* = \frac{2\rho_{2,min}}{m} = 46.794701$$

Applications of results shown in Table 7.5.1 (see Chapter 11 of Litvin & Fuentes, 2004) provides the following limiting value of the number of shaper teeth:

$$N_s^* = 1.004 N_2^* - 9.162 = 37.8199$$

Approach B provides a more conservative result than the exact solution provided by Approach A.

# Application for Design of Planetary Gear Train with Noncircular and Circular Gears

#### 8.1 Introduction

A planetary gear train with noncircular and circular gears (Litvin & Ketov, 1949) may be applied in design for the following purposes:

- (1) For providing a lesser pressure angle for each pair of applied gears of the discussed train.
- (2) For design of a function y(x),  $x_2 \ge x \ge x_1$ , for which derivative y' varies its sign in the mentioned interval. The design function will be obtained as the output of the planetary gear train. We recall that function y(x) with varied sign of y'(x) cannot be generated by a pair of noncircular gears (see Section 10.3).
- (3) For obtaining as the output of the planetary train a product  $f_1(x) \cdot f_2(x)$  of two nonlinear functions.

## 8.2 Structure and Basic Kinematic Concept of Planetary Train

We limit the discussions to a planetary gear train formed by two pairs of gears being in external meshing. The first set of gears is formed by gears 1 and 2, and the second set by gears 3 and 4 (Fig. 8.2.1). One of the gears, say gear 1, is held at rest. Gears 2 and 3 are called *satellites*. They are mounted on the carrier c and have two degrees of freedom (i) in the motion with the carrier, and (ii) in relative motion, rotation about the carrier.

Notation  $\phi_{41}^{(c)}$  indicates that transformation of rotation is performed from gear 1 to gear 4 wherein carrier c is held at rest, and gears 1 and 2, 3 and 4 form a conventional gear train (not a planetary one). We then have

<span id="page-155-3"></span>
$$\phi_{41}^{(c)} = \phi_4(\phi_3(\phi_2(\phi_1))) \tag{8.2.1}$$

Here,  $\phi_3 \equiv \phi_2$  because gears 3 and 2 do not perform rotation with respect to each other. Another notation,  $\phi_{4c}^{(1)}$ , indicates that transformation of rotation is performed from carrier c to gear 4 wherein gear 1 is held at rest. It follows from the kinematics of a planetary gear train that

<span id="page-155-4"></span><span id="page-155-2"></span>
$$\phi_{4c}^{(1)} = \phi_{41}^{(c)} - \phi_1 \tag{8.2.2}$$

<span id="page-156-5"></span><span id="page-156-4"></span><span id="page-156-2"></span><span id="page-156-1"></span><span id="page-156-0"></span>![](_page_156_Picture_2.jpeg)

Figure 8.2.1. Structure of planetary train with two pairs of gears and carrier *c*.

Equation (8.2.2) may be obtained as follows:

- (1) Consider that all four gears and the carrier perform rotation being rotated as a rigid body. The angle of rotation is  $\phi_c$  and the positions of the gears and the carrier are determined by  $\phi_c$ .
- (2) However, because gear 1 is fixed, it is necessary to return gear 1 to the initial position. This is obtained by rotation of gear 1 in the direction that is opposite to the rotation performed in stage 1. The angle of rotation is  $|\phi_1| = |\phi_c|$ . At stage 2, the rotations of gears 1, 2, 3, and 4 are performed about their axes and the positions of the gears are determined by Eq. (8.2.2).

The final positions of the gears and the carrier obtained by rotation at steps 1 and 2 are determined by Eq. (8.2.2). This yields Eq. (8.2.2), which may be represented as

<span id="page-156-3"></span>
$$\phi_{4c}^{(1)} = \phi_{41}^{(c)} - \phi_1 = \phi_4(\phi_3(\phi_2(\phi_1))) - \phi_1 \tag{8.2.3}$$

Equation (8.2.3) has been derived considering that gears 1 and 2, 3 and 4, are in external meshing. The discussed approach may be extended for the case wherein gears of the planetary train have a mixed meshing, external and internal.

#### 8.3 Planetary Gear Train with Elliptical Gears

Figure 8.3.1(a) shows a planetary gear with two pairs of identical elliptical gears 1 and 2, 3 and 4. The purpose of application of two pairs of gears is increasing the variation of the ratio of angular velocities of the input and output links of the train,

<span id="page-157-3"></span>![](_page_157_Picture_2.jpeg)

Figure 8.3.1. Planetary gear train with two pairs of elliptical gears: (a) initial position of carrier *c* and elliptical gears 1, 2, and 3, 4; (b) position of gears 2, 3, 4 and carrier *c* after rotation of carrier on angle φ*<sup>c</sup>* whereas gear 1 is held at rest.

but with observation of limitation of pressure angle α<sup>12</sup> for each pair of two elliptical gears (see Section [3.4\)](#page-54-3).

The derivation of transmission function φ(*c*) <sup>41</sup> (see Eq. [\(8.2.1\)](#page-155-3)) is performed as follows:

(i) Transmission function φ2(φ1) is determined as (see Section [4.3.2.1\)](#page-62-5)

<span id="page-157-0"></span>
$$\tan\left(\frac{\phi_2}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{1+e}{1-e}\right)\tan\frac{\phi_1}{2} \tag{8.3.1}$$

(ii) Similarly, we obtain that

<span id="page-157-1"></span>
$$\tan\left(\frac{\phi_4}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{1+e}{1-e}\right)\tan\frac{\phi_3}{2} \tag{8.3.2}$$

We take into account in further derivations that φ<sup>3</sup> ≡ φ2. Gears 2 and 3 are mounted on the carrier and perform rotation with respect to the carrier with the same angular velocity.

(iii) Equations [\(8.3.1\)](#page-157-0) and [\(8.3.2\)](#page-157-1) yield

<span id="page-157-2"></span>
$$\phi_{41}^{(c)} = 2 \arctan \left[ \left( \frac{1+e}{1-e} \right)^2 \tan \left( \frac{\phi_1}{2} \right) \right]$$
 (8.3.3)

The meaning of Eq. [\(8.3.3\)](#page-157-2) is that application of two pairs of elliptical gears is equivalent to application of one pair of elliptical gears with a very large eccentricity.

<span id="page-158-4"></span><span id="page-158-1"></span><span id="page-158-0"></span>![](_page_158_Figure_2.jpeg)

<span id="page-158-2"></span>Figure 8.3.2. Illustration of (a) transmission function φ4(φ*c*); (b) derivative function *m*4*<sup>c</sup>* = ω4/ω*c*.

However, large eccentricity is accompanied with a large pressure angle (see Section [3.4\)](#page-54-2), but this is avoided by application of a planetary gear train with two pairs of elliptical gears.

Drawings of Fig. [8.3.2\(](#page-158-2)a) show that the output of the planetary train (function φ4(φ*c*)) is a function of reverse motion of gear 4 performed while the carrier is rotated in the same direction. Figure [8.3.2\(](#page-158-2)b) shows that the derivative function *m*4*c*(φ*c*) varies its sign in the interval of generation. Such variation (of the sign) is impossible for generation of a function by application of one pair of noncircular gears (see Chapter 10).

### **8.4 Planetary Gear Train with Noncircular and Circular Gears**

It will be represented in Chapter [10](#page-164-3) that generation of a function *y*(*x*) requires that the derivative *y* (*x*) must be positive in the interval of generation. This obstacle may be avoided if instead of *y*(*x*) the following function is generated:

<span id="page-158-3"></span>
$$y_1(x) = y(x) + bx$$
 (8.4.1)

with observation *y* <sup>1</sup>(*x*) > 0 in the interval of generation.

To obtain as the output function *y*(*x*) with a varied sign of derivative *y* (*x*), it becomes necessary the subtraction of linear function

$$y_2(x) = bx \tag{8.4.2}$$

from function *y*1(*x*). Such subtraction has been performed by application of a spiral bevel gear differential for derivation of *y*(*x*) = sin *x* (see Chapter [10\)](#page-164-2).

Similar generation may be accomplished by application of a planetary gear train as follows:

- (1) Assume that noncircular gears 1 and 2 (Fig. [8.2.1\)](#page-156-2) generate the function Eq. [\(8.4.1\)](#page-158-3). Circular gears 3 and 4 are designed with gear ratio 1, and φ(*c*) <sup>41</sup> is proportional to *y*1(*x*) = *y*(*x*) + *bx*.
- (2) Taking into account Eq. [\(8.2.2\)](#page-155-4), we obtain that the output of the planetary train, φ(1) <sup>4</sup>*<sup>c</sup>* , is proportional to function *y*(*x*) = sin *x*.

Meshing of a noncircular gear with a rack is considered in this book in two different ways: (i) wherein the rack is a generating tool, and (ii) the rack and the noncircular gear form a mechanism for transformation of motion.

Figure 9.1.1 illustrates that for previous case (ii), rotation with angular velocity  $\omega_1$  is transformed into translation with velocity  $v_2$  and the ratio  $\omega_1/v_2$  varies. The mechanism applied for such transformation of motion (Fig. 9.1.1) is formed by a noncircular gear 1 and rack 2. The centrodes 1 and 2 are curves determined by function  $s_2(\phi_1)$ , denoted as  $F(\phi_1)$ .

The instantaneous point I of tangency of centrodes (Fig. 9.1.1) is determined as follows:

(1) The derivative  $F'(\phi_1)$  of function  $s_2(\phi_1) = F(\phi_1)$  is obtained as

$$F'(\phi_1) = \frac{ds_2}{d\phi_1} = \left(\frac{ds_2}{dt}\right) \left(\frac{dt}{d\phi_1}\right) = \frac{v_2}{\omega_1}$$
 (9.1.1)

where  $v_2 = \frac{ds_2}{dt}$  is the instantaneous velocity of translation of rack 2, and  $\frac{d\phi_1}{dt}$  is the instantaneous velocity of rotation of noncircular gear 1.

- (2) The instantaneous center I of rotation of gear 1 and rack 2 (in relative motion) is located at a point of line  $\overline{O_1n}$ . Here,  $O_1$  is the center of rotation of the gear 1, and  $\overline{O_1n}$  is drawn perpendicular to velocity  $\mathbf{v}_2$  of translation. The relative velocity  $\mathbf{v}_{12} = \mathbf{v}_1 \mathbf{v}_2$  is equal to zero at point I.
- (3) The location  $|\overline{O_1I}|$  of the instantaneous center of rotation on line  $\overline{O_1n}$  is determined as

$$\mathbf{v}_2 = \mathbf{v}_1 = \boldsymbol{\omega}_1 \times \overline{O_1 I}$$

We then obtain that

$$|\overline{O_1 I}| = \frac{v_2}{\omega_1} = F'(\phi_1) \tag{9.1.2}$$

#### 9.2 Determination of Centrodes of Noncircular Gear and Rack

Centrodes 1 and 2 are traced out by the instantaneous center I of rotation in coordinate systems  $S_1$  and  $S_2$  that are rigidly connected to gear 1 and rack 2, respectively.

(i) Centrode 1 is a polar curve determined as

<span id="page-161-3"></span><span id="page-161-2"></span>
$$r_1(\phi_1) = F'(\phi_1)$$
 (9.2.1)

The polar axis is  $\overline{O_1A_1}$  (Fig. 9.2.1(a)), and  $r_1(\phi_1)$  is the current position vector of centrode 1.

(ii) Centrode 2 (Fig. 9.2.1(b)) is represented in coordinate system  $(x_2, y_2)$  by

$$x_2 = \int_0^{\phi_1} r_1(\phi_1) d\phi, \qquad y_2 = r_1(\phi_1) - r_1^{(0)}(\phi_1^{(0)})$$
 (9.2.2)

### 9.3 Application of Mechanism Formed by a Noncircular Gear and Rack

Consider that the mechanism formed by a noncircular gear and a rack shown in Fig. 9.1.1 is applied for generation of function  $y = f(x), x_2 \ge x \ge x_1$  as follows:

(i) Angle  $\phi_1$  of rotation of noncircular gear and translation  $s_2$  of rack are represented as

<span id="page-161-4"></span>
$$\phi_1 = \kappa_1(x - x_1) \tag{9.3.1}$$

<span id="page-161-5"></span>
$$s_2 = \kappa_2(y - y_1) = \kappa_2[f(x) - f(x_1)]$$
 (9.3.2)

where  $\kappa_1$  and  $\kappa_2$  are scalar coefficients. Equations (9.3.1) and (9.3.2) determine function  $s_2(\phi_1)$  parametrically.

Figure 9.2.1. Toward derivation of centrodes 1 and 2: (a) centrode 1 of noncircular gear; (b) centrode 2 of rack.

(ii) Function of gear ratio is obtained as

$$F'(\phi_1) = \frac{ds_2}{d\phi_1} = \left(\frac{ds_2}{dx}\right) \left(\frac{dx}{d\phi_1}\right) = \frac{\kappa_2}{\kappa_1} f'(x) \tag{9.3.3}$$

(iii) Gear centrode (Fig. 9.2.1(a)) is determined parametrically as

$$\phi_1 = \kappa_1(x - x_1) \tag{9.3.4}$$

$$r_1(x) = \frac{\kappa_2}{\kappa_1} f'(x) \tag{9.3.5}$$

(iv) The centrode of the rack is determined in coordinate system  $(x_2, y_2)$  as

$$x_2(x) = \kappa_2[f(x) - f(x_1)]$$
 (9.3.6)

$$y_2(x) = r_1 - r_{10} = \frac{\kappa_2}{\kappa_1} [f'(x) - f'(x_1)]$$
 (9.3.7)

Axis  $x_2(x)$  coincides with the direction of translational motion of the rack. We recall that derivative f'(x) of the generated function y(x) is to be a smooth and differentiable function.

<span id="page-163-0"></span>**NUMERICAL EXAMPLE 9.3.1.** Consider generation of function *y*(*x*) = κ3*x*2, *xa* ≥ *x* ≥ *xb*, where *xa* = 200 m, *xb* = 1,200 m, κ<sup>3</sup> = 2.5 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>6</sup> s/m. Centrode 1 is an unclosed curve. Coefficient κ<sup>1</sup> = 0.4 · (π/360) 1/m; κ<sup>2</sup> = 1/12 1/s. The units of *x* and *y* are in meters (m) and seconds (s), respectively.

The angle of rotation of gear and displacement *s*<sup>2</sup> of the rack are represented as

$$\phi_1(x) = \kappa_1(x - x_a) \tag{9.3.8}$$

$$s_2(y) = \kappa_2(y - y(x_a))$$
 (9.3.9)

where κ<sup>1</sup> and κ<sup>2</sup> are the assigned coefficients. The gear centrode is represented by

$$\phi_1(x) = \kappa_1(x - x_a) \tag{9.3.10}$$

$$r_1(x) = \frac{ds_2}{d\phi_1} = \frac{2\kappa_2\kappa_3}{\kappa_1}x\tag{9.3.11}$$

It is easy to verify that *r*1(φ1) is an Archimedes spiral.

The centrode of the rack is represented in coordinate system (*x*2, *y*2) by

$$x_2 = \kappa_2 \kappa_3 (x^2 - x_a^2) \tag{9.3.12}$$

$$y_2 = r_1(x) - r(x_a) = \frac{2\kappa_2\kappa_3}{\kappa_1}(x - x_a)$$
 (9.3.13)

#### **10.1 Introduction**

In the past, generation of functions based on synthesis of planar linkages was the subject of research of many distinguished researchers based on synthesis of planar linkages [\(Artobolevski](#page-218-18) *et al.*, 1959; [Burmester, 1888;](#page-218-2) [Chebyshev, 1955;](#page-218-19) Freudenstein, [1955\). The success of modern technology for the manufacture of noncircular gears](#page-218-20) has inspired researchers to apply noncircular gears for generation of functions [\(](#page-219-6)[Dooner, 2001](#page-218-21)[;](#page-219-6) Litvin *et al.*[, 2008;](#page-219-3) [Ottaviano](#page-219-4) *et al.*, 2008; [Modler](#page-219-5) *et al.*, 2009; Litvin *et al.*, 2009).

The contents of this chapter cover generation of functions by a single pair of noncircular gears and a new approach for generation of functions by application of a multigear drive with noncircular gears. It follows from the kinematics of gear generation that function *y*(*x*), *x*<sup>1</sup> ≤ *x* ≤ *x*2, to be generated must be a monotonous increasing function with derivative *y* (*x*) > 0. In the case wherein the derivative *y* (*x*) is of a varied sign in the interval of derivation, an algorithm for function generation is represented (see Section [10.3\)](#page-170-3).

The application of a multigear drive with noncircular gears for function generation has the following advantages: (i) obtaining an integrated impact for the output results, (ii) favorable conditions of force transmission, and (iii) performance of synthesis with a number of design parameters substantially increased.

The specific characteristic of the proposed approach for application of a multigear drive is illustrated as follows:

- (a) Figure [10.1.1](#page-165-0) shows the centrodes of a gear drive wherein only a single pair of gears is applied (Fig. [10.1.1\(](#page-165-0)a)) for generation of function ψ(α) (Fig. [10.1.1\(](#page-165-0)b)).
- (b) Figure [10.1.2\(](#page-166-0)a) shows the case wherein two pairs of gears are applied for generation of function ψ(α) [\(10.1.2\(](#page-166-0)b)). We then have that (i) the transmission function of centrodes 1 and 2 is β(α) ≡ *g*1(α), and (ii) transmission function of gears 3 and 4 is δ(γ ) ≡ *g*2(*g*1(α)).
- (c) It is shown later that the shape of a pair of centrodes that generate function *gi*(α) depends on the derivative *dgi*/*d*α . Figures [10.1.3\(](#page-167-0)a), (b), and (c) show the derivatives of transmission functions for the cases wherein the design is based

Centrodes of a multigear drive with three pairs of gears are shown in Fig. [10.1.4.](#page-168-0)

Drawings of Fig. [10.1.3](#page-167-1) confirm that the magnitude of the derivative of the transmission function is substantially decreased in a multigear drive. Another advantage of application of a multigear drive is the increase of the integrated impact of the final output result.

The theory of design of a multigear drive has been developed and is represented here. This chapter also covers the tandem design of a planar linkage coupled with **10.1 Introduction 149**

A functional for generation of a function by a pair of identical centrodes is represented in Section [4.5.](#page-83-6)

#### **10.2 General Aspects of Generation of Functions**

The following conditions must be observed for generation of functions by noncircular gears:

(1) The function chosen for generation must satisfy the requirement for a function to be *strongly monotonic* [\(Korn & Korn, 1968\)](#page-218-13):

A real function *f*(*x*) of a real variable *x* is strongly monotonic in (*a*, *b*) if *f*(*x*) increases as *x* increases in (*a*, *b*) (increasing monotonic function), or if *f*(*x*) decreases as *x* increases in (*a*, *b*) (decreasing monotonic function).

- (2) We assume that the function to be generated is a strongly increasing monotonic function in the considered interval, and for *x*<sup>1</sup> < *x*<sup>2</sup> we have that *f*(*x*1) < *f*(*x*2).
- (3) Depending on the type of *f*(*x*), the centrodes of noncircular gears that generate *f*(*x*), might be closed or unclosed curves. The conditions for obtaining centrodes as closed curves are formulated in Section [2.6.](#page-41-5)
- (4) The main idea of generation of *f*(*x*) by noncircular gears is that the angles φ<sup>1</sup> and φ<sup>2</sup> of rotation of gear 1 and 2 are proportional to (*x* − *x*1) and *f*(*x*) − *f*(*x*1), respectively.
- (5) The scalar coefficients *k*<sup>1</sup> and *k*<sup>2</sup> in

$$\phi_1 = k_1(x - x_1), \qquad \phi_2 = k_2[y(x) - y(x_1)]$$
 (10.2.1)

are constant and represent the proportionality discussed previously. Coefficients *k*<sup>1</sup> and *k*<sup>2</sup> must be assigned observing limitations of pressure angle α<sup>12</sup> of the gear mechanism (see Section [3.4\)](#page-54-3). In some cases, it may require generation of the function by two (even more) pairs of noncircular gears performing transformation of rotation in sequence (as represented later) for the purpose of reduction of the pressure angle.

(6) It is obvious that although the rotation of noncircular gears is performed with variation of gear ratio, the direction of rotation of the gears cannot be changed in the process of transformation of rotation. Simple derivations yield

<span id="page-169-2"></span>
$$m_{21}(x) = \frac{d\phi_2}{d\phi_1} = \frac{k_2}{k_1} f'(x)$$
 (10.2.2)

It follows from Eq. [\(10.2.2\)](#page-169-2) that the derivative *f* (*x*) of the function being generated must be positive in the interval of generation, *x*<sup>2</sup> ≥ *x* ≥ *x*1.

(7) A special approach that allows generation of function *f*(*x*) with variation of the sign of the derivative *f* (*x*) is represented in the next section.

#### <span id="page-170-3"></span><span id="page-170-2"></span>**10.3 Generation of Function with Varied Sign of Derivative**

Function *y*(*x*), *x*<sup>1</sup> ≤ *x* ≤ *x*2, to be generated by a pair of noncircular gears, must be a monotonous increasing function for which derivative *y* (*x*) > 0. The following procedure is applied for generation of a function wherein the derivative *y* (*x*) is of a varied sign in the interval of derivation (Fig. [10.3.1\)](#page-165-0):

(a) Instead of function *y*(*x*) assigned for generation (wherein *y* (*x*) is of a varied sign), function

<span id="page-170-6"></span><span id="page-170-4"></span>
$$y_1(x) = y(x) + bx, \quad x_1 \le x \le x_2,$$
 (10.3.1)

is generated. The conditions of generation of a function by a pair of noncircular gears, formulated as

$$y_1'(x) \ge 0,$$

may then be observed.

- (b) Function *y*(*x*) assigned for generation is obtained by the approach illustrated by Fig. [10.3.2](#page-166-0) as follows:
  - (i) Function

<span id="page-170-7"></span><span id="page-170-5"></span>
$$y_2(x) = bx (10.3.2)$$

is subtracted from *y*1(*x*) by application of a gear differential. Two gear mechanisms formed by (a) noncircular gears 1 and 2, and (b) circular gears 3 and 4, are applied.

(ii) Gears 1 and 3 are mounted on the same shaft, and angles φ<sup>1</sup> and φ<sup>3</sup> are proportional to the variable *x*. The design of centrodes of gears 1 and 2 provides that angle of rotation of gear 2 is proportional to the function given by Eq. [\(10.3.1\)](#page-170-4); similarly, angle of rotation of gear 4 is proportional to the function given by Eq. [\(10.3.2\)](#page-170-5).

Figure 10.3.2. Structure of gear mechanism formed by a bevel gear differential (bevel gears *I* and *I I*, satellite *s*, and carrier *c*), noncircular gears 1 and 2, and circular gears 3 and 4.

- (iii) Rotations of gears 2 and 4 are provided to the carrier *c* of the satellite *s* of the gear differential, and to gear *I I* of the differential, respectively.
- (iv) The differential provides the following relation between the angles of rotation of the carrier *c* and gears *I* and *I I* (Fig. [10.3.2\)](#page-166-1):

<span id="page-171-0"></span>
$$\phi_I + \phi_{II} = 2\phi_c \tag{10.3.3}$$

Angle of rotation φ*<sup>c</sup>* is equivalent to φ2, and angle of rotation φ*I I* is equivalent to φ4.

Equation [\(10.3.3\)](#page-171-0) yields

<span id="page-171-1"></span>
$$\phi_I = 2\phi_c - \phi_{II}, \quad \phi_c \equiv \phi_2, \quad \phi_{II} \equiv \phi_4 \tag{10.3.4}$$

where φ<sup>2</sup> is proportional to *y*1(*x*) represented by Eq. [\(10.3.1\)](#page-170-6) and φ<sup>4</sup> is proportional to *y*2(*x*) represented by Eq.[\(10.3.2\)](#page-170-7).

We assign for the design that

<span id="page-171-2"></span>
$$\phi_4 = 2b\phi_3, \quad \phi_3 \equiv \phi_1 \quad (y_2(x) = 2x)$$
 (10.3.5)

(v) Equations [\(10.3.4\)](#page-171-1) and [\(10.3.5\)](#page-171-2) yield that angle φ*<sup>I</sup>* of rotation of gear *I* of the differential is obtained as proportional to function *y*(*x*) assigned for design

$$\phi_I = 2\phi_2 - \phi_4 = 2(y(x) + bx) - 2bx = 2y(x)$$
 (10.3.6)

Variation of function *y*(*x*) by the magnitude and sign will cause variation of angle φ*<sup>I</sup>* of rotation of gear *I* of the differential. This means that gear *I* will be rotated with varied angular velocity in two directions.

The scheme of function generation with varied signed represented by Fig. [10.3.2](#page-166-0) is applied.

Noncircular gears 1 and 2 must be designed for generation of function

$$y_1(x) = \sin x + bx, \quad 0 \le x \le 2\pi$$
 (10.3.7)

Design of noncircular gears 1 and 2 (Fig. [10.3.2\)](#page-166-0) must cover determination of their centrodes by application of the following procedure:

(i) The angles of rotation of gears 1 and 2 are represented by

<span id="page-172-2"></span>
$$\phi_1 = k_1(x - x_1), \quad \phi_2 = k_2[y_1(x) - y_1(x_1)], \quad x_1 = 0$$
 (10.3.8)

Here, *k*<sup>1</sup> and *k*<sup>2</sup> are scale coefficients determined as

$$k_1 = \frac{\phi_{1,max}}{x_2 - x_1}, \quad k_2 = \frac{\phi_{2,max}}{y_1(x_2) - y_1(x_1)}, \quad x_2 = 2\pi, \quad x_1 = 0$$
 (10.3.9)

Taking that gears 1 and 2 will perform in the process of generation turns on φ1,*max* = φ2,*max* = 2π, we obtain

<span id="page-172-3"></span>
$$k_1 = 1, \quad k_2 = \frac{1}{b}$$
 (10.3.10)

- (ii) The coefficient *b* may be determined by observation of the following conditions: (a) *y* (*x*) > 0, and (b) centrodes of gears 1 and 2 must be convex.
- (iii) The gear ratio function is

$$m_{21}(x) = \frac{d\phi_2}{d\phi_1} = \frac{\cos x}{b} + 1$$
 (10.3.11)

It is obvious that *m*21(*x*) > 0 because *b* > 1. The conditions of convexity of centrodes 1 and 2 have been represented in Section [2.9](#page-47-5) by inequalities represented by Eq. [\(2.9.2\)](#page-47-6) and [\(2.9.3\)](#page-47-7). The condition of convexity of centrode 1 yields

<span id="page-172-0"></span>
$$(\cos x + b)^3 + 2b(1 + b\cos x) + b^2(b + \cos x) \ge 0$$
 (10.3.12)

We then assume that there is such a limiting value of *b* with which the left side of Eq. [\(10.3.12\)](#page-172-0) does not become equal to zero at *x* = π. This yields that the left side of Eq. [\(10.3.12\)](#page-172-0) is not equal to zero at other values of *x* of the interval 2π ≥ *x* ≥ 0. This allows us to obtain an inequality:

<span id="page-172-1"></span>
$$(b-1)^2 - 2b + b^2 \ge 0 (10.3.13)$$

because *b* > 1.

It follows from Eq. [\(10.3.13\)](#page-172-1) that the limiting value of *b* is *blim* ≥ 1.707. Analysis of condition of convexity of centrode of gear 2 (centrode 2) yields the same limiting value of *b*, *blim* ≥ 1.707. Observation of condition *blim* = 1.707 means that the centrode will have a point with curvature κ<sup>1</sup> = 0.

(iv) Equations [\(10.3.8\)](#page-172-2) with coefficients of Eq. [\(10.3.10\)](#page-172-3) yield the following transmission function,

$$\phi_2(\phi_1) = \phi_1 + \frac{1}{b}\sin\phi_1, \quad 0 \le \phi_1 \le 2\pi$$
 (10.3.14)

<span id="page-173-4"></span><span id="page-173-3"></span><span id="page-173-1"></span><span id="page-173-0"></span>The derivative function is

$$m_{12}(\phi_1) = \frac{d\phi_1}{d\phi_2} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{h}\cos\phi_1}$$
 (10.3.15)

(v) Equations (2.4.2), (2.4.4), and (2.4.5) (see Chapter 2) yield the following equations for centrodes  $\sigma_1$  and  $\sigma_2$  of noncircular gears 1 and 2 (Fig. 10.3.2): For  $\sigma_1$ , we have

$$r_1(\phi_1) = \frac{E}{1 + m_{12}(\phi_1)} = E \frac{1 + \frac{1}{b}\cos\phi_1}{2 + \frac{1}{b}\cos\phi_1}$$
(10.3.16)

For  $\sigma_2$ , we have

$$r_2(\phi_1) = E \frac{1}{2 + \frac{1}{b}\cos\phi_1}, \quad \phi_2(\phi_1) = \phi_1 + \frac{1}{b}\sin\phi_1$$
 (10.3.17)

Center distance E is just a scale coefficient. Centrodes  $\sigma_1$  and  $\sigma_2$ , determined with coefficients b = 1.707 and b = 1.400, are represented in Figs. 10.3.3 and 10.3.4. Centrode 1 in Fig. 10.3.4 is convex-concave.

(vi) We assign for the design that

(vii) Function  $y(x) = a \sin x$  will be obtained from gear I of the differential as

$$\phi_I = 2\phi_c - \phi_{II} = 2\phi_2 - \phi_4 = 2\left(\phi_1 + \frac{1}{b}\sin\phi_1\right) - 2\phi_1 = \frac{2}{b}\sin\phi_1 \quad (10.3.19)$$
wherein  $\frac{2}{a} = a$ .

Noncircular gears with the developed centrodes may be generated by the enveloping method by using a hob and a shaper for centrodes shown in Figs. 10.3.3 and 10.3.4, respectively.

#### 10.4 Introduction to Design of Multigear Drive with Noncircular Gears

#### 10.4.1 Basic Functionals

Consider that a given function  $\psi(\alpha)$  is generated by a gear drive formed by n pairs of noncircular gears (Fig. 10.4.1). Each pair of gears with conjugated centrodes  $\sigma_1$  and  $\sigma_2$  (generally  $\sigma_1$  does not coincide with  $\sigma_2$ ) generates a function  $f(\alpha)$ . The functional of the gear drive with n pairs is represented as

<span id="page-173-2"></span>
$$\psi(\alpha) = f(f(f(\dots f(\alpha)))) = \prod f(\alpha)$$
 (10.4.1)

The solution of the functional means determination of function  $f(\alpha)$  considering as given  $\psi(\alpha)$ . Knowing  $f(\alpha)$ , it becomes possible to derive a pair of centrodes  $\sigma_1$

and  $\sigma_2$  for generation of function  $f(\alpha)$ . However, the solution of Functional (10.4.1) (determination of  $f(\alpha)$ ), even if such solution exists, is a difficult problem.

For the case of generation of  $\psi(\alpha)$  by application of n pairs of noncircular gears, we use the functional

<span id="page-174-3"></span><span id="page-174-1"></span>
$$\psi(\alpha) = g_n(g_{n-1}(g_{n-2}(\dots g_1(\alpha)))), \quad g_k(\alpha) \neq g_{k-1}(\alpha)$$
 (10.4.2)

with observation of following conditions:

- (i) Each function  $g_k$  (k = 1, ..., n) is generated by a pair of conjugated centrodes  $(\sigma_1^{(k)}, \sigma_2^{(k)}), k = 1, ..., n$ .
- (ii) Centrode  $\sigma_1^{(k)}$  is mounted on the shaft of centrode  $\sigma_2^{(k-1)}$ , and the angles of rotation  $\phi_{2k-1}$  and  $\phi_{2k-2}$  of centrodes  $\sigma_1^{(k)}$  and  $\sigma_2^{(k-1)}$ , respectively, are equal (see Fig. 10.4.2).

The angle of rotation of centrode  $\sigma_1^{(k)}$  is proportional to function  $g_{k-1}(\alpha) \equiv \phi_{2k-1}(\alpha)$  (see Fig. 10.4.2). The angle of rotation of centrode  $\sigma_2^{(k)}$  is proportional to function  $g_k(\alpha) \equiv \phi_{2k}(\alpha)$  (see Fig. 10.4.2).

- (vi) Generation of ψ(α) by Functional [\(10.4.2\)](#page-174-1) is in some sense equivalent to the split of ψ(α) between the generating gears (centrodes). It allows us to reduce the pressure angle and provide a favorable shape for the centrodes. This great advantage is achieved due to the reduction of the derivatives of functions *gk*(*gk*−1) with respect to function ψ(α) (see numerical examples following).
- (vii) The split of function ψ(α) by its generation (see Functional [\(10.4.2\)](#page-174-1)) may be applied as well for technological processes, not only for generation of functions.

#### **10.4.2 Interpretations of Lagrange's Theorem**

Two interpretations of Lagrange's theorem are considered:

(a) **Mean Value Theorem** [\(Korn & Korn, 1968\)](#page-218-13). Assume that function *f*(*x*) is continuous on the closed interval [*a*, *b*] and continuously differentiable on the open interval (*a*, *b*). There is then such a point *c* (Fig. [10.4.3\)](#page-174-0) where

<span id="page-177-2"></span>
$$\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} = f'(c), \quad x(c) = a + \theta(b - a), \quad 0 < \theta < 1$$
 (10.4.3)

<span id="page-178-10"></span><span id="page-178-9"></span><span id="page-178-1"></span><span id="page-178-0"></span>Equation (10.4.3) means that on the smooth curve (Fig. 10.4.3) between (A, B), there is such a point C at which the tangent is parallel to the chord A - B.

(b) **Final Increment of Function** (Fichtengolz, 1958). Using Eq. (10.4.3), we may formulate the final increase of a function. Assume that at point  $x = x_o$ , there is an increase of  $\Delta x$ . Equation (10.4.3) then yields

<span id="page-178-2"></span>
$$\frac{f(x_o + \Delta x) - f(x_o)}{\Delta x} = f'(x_o + \theta \Delta x), \quad 0 < \theta < 1$$
 (10.4.4)

The increase  $\Delta f(x_o)$  of the function is represented as  $\Delta f(x_o) = f(x_o + \Delta x) - f(x_o)$ .

Assume now that we consider the increase of function f(a) at point a, where the increase  $\Delta x$  is h = b - a; then we obtain from Eq. (10.4.4) that the increase of function on the interval (a, b) is

<span id="page-178-8"></span>
$$\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} = f'(a+\theta h), \quad 0 < \theta < 1$$
 (10.4.5)

# **10.4.3** Illustration of Application of Lagrange's Theorem for Functional $\psi(\alpha) = g_2(g_1(\alpha))$

The functional applied for generation of given function  $\psi(\alpha)$  is represented as

<span id="page-178-7"></span>
$$\psi(\alpha) = g_2(g_1(\alpha)) \tag{10.4.6}$$

Centrodes  $\sigma_1^{(1)}$  and  $\sigma_2^{(1)}$  (see Fig. 10.1.2(a)) generate function  $g_1(\alpha) \equiv \beta(\alpha)$ . Centrodes  $\sigma_1^{(2)}$  and  $\sigma_2^{(2)}$  (see Fig. 10.1.2(a)) generate function  $g_2(\alpha) \equiv \delta(\alpha)$ . Function  $g_2(\alpha) \neq g_1(\alpha)$  and centrodes  $\sigma_1^{(1)}$  and  $\sigma_2^{(1)}$  are not identical to centrodes  $\sigma_1^{(2)}$  and  $\sigma_2^{(2)}$ , respectively. The centrodes might be as well non-closed, but the maximal angles of rotation of all centrodes must be equal.

#### **10.4.3.1** Previous Solutions for $\psi(\alpha) = f(f(\alpha))$ .

Collatz approach (Collatz, 1951) is based on the following considerations:

(i) It is assumed that the solution for the functional

<span id="page-178-4"></span><span id="page-178-3"></span>
$$\psi(\alpha) = f(f(\alpha)) \tag{10.4.7}$$

exists.

(ii) In addition, it is assumed that function  $\psi(\alpha)$  may be represented as a power series

<span id="page-178-5"></span>
$$\psi(\alpha) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \psi_n \alpha^n \tag{10.4.8}$$

(iii) The solution of Functional (10.4.7) may then be obtained as

<span id="page-178-6"></span>
$$f(\alpha) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n \alpha^n$$
 (10.4.9)

<span id="page-179-2"></span>![](_page_179_Picture_2.jpeg)

Figure 10.4.4. Illustration of discrete representation of function *f*(α) as the solution of functional ψ(α) = *f*( *f*(α)) with given function ψ(α).

The coefficients *an* are determined by solution of nonlinear equations obtained by simultaneous consideration of Eqs. [\(10.4.7\)](#page-178-4), [\(10.4.8\)](#page-178-5), and [\(10.4.9\)](#page-178-6). A computerized procedure for determination of coefficients *an* in Eq. [\(10.4.9\)](#page-178-6) is to be provided.

Collatz has considered as well a particular case wherein the sought-for function *f*(α) may be represented discretely. Consider functional ψ(α) = *f*( *f*(α)) with a given function ψ(α). It is known from Collatz [\(Collatz, 1951\)](#page-218-24) that *f*(α) may be represented discretely if a single point *A* of *f*(α) is known exactly, and the limitation is that *f*(α*i*) = *i*.

Drawings of Fig. [10.4.4](#page-175-0) show the discrete presentation of *f*(α) that is based on the relations

<span id="page-179-0"></span>
$$\alpha_{i+1} = f(\alpha_i), \qquad f(\alpha_{i+1}) = \psi(\alpha_i) \tag{10.4.10}$$

Considering point *A* of *f*(α*i*) as known, points *D*, *C*, ... , of *f*(α) may be determined.

Differentiation of Eq. [\(10.4.10\)](#page-179-0) provides

<span id="page-179-1"></span>
$$f'(\alpha_i) \cdot f'(\alpha_{i+1}) = \psi'(\alpha_i) \tag{10.4.11}$$

Denoting α*<sup>i</sup>* and α*i*+<sup>1</sup> as conjugated, we may represent Eq. [\(10.4.11\)](#page-179-1) as

$$f'(\alpha_i) \cdot f'[f(\alpha_i)] = \psi'(\alpha_i) \tag{10.4.12}$$

<span id="page-180-9"></span><span id="page-180-1"></span><span id="page-180-0"></span>The disadvantages of the discrete presentation of  $f(\alpha)$  are (i) the exact solution of  $\psi(\alpha) = f(f(\alpha))$  is required for at least one point of  $f(\alpha)$ ; (ii) the location of conjugated points of  $f(\alpha)$  is prescribed ahead. However, an iterative process for discrete presentation of  $f(\alpha)$  may be applied.

An approximate solution of Functional (10.4.7) was proposed by Kislitzin (Kislitzin, 1955) by considering the functional

<span id="page-180-2"></span>
$$\phi(\phi(x)) = f(x) \tag{10.4.13}$$

The approximate solution of Functional (10.4.13) was represented by Kislitzin as

$$\phi(x) \approx \frac{f(x) + x\sqrt{f'(x)}}{1 + \sqrt{f'(x)}}$$
(10.4.14)

Litvin (Litvin, 1956) has considered the Functional (10.4.6) and applied the Lagrange's theorem for the mean value of a function (Korn & Korn, 1968) for derivation of  $g_1(\alpha)$  (see below). In addition, Litvin has proposed the derivation of centrodes for  $g_1(\alpha)$  and  $g_2(\alpha)$  that provide exact generation of  $\psi(\alpha)$ .

#### 10.4.3.2 Computational Procedure for Functional (10.4.6).

The approach proposed by Litvin (Litvin, 1956) has been extended now for gear drives with n pairs of centrodes.

The approach for a gear drive with two pairs of gears is formulated as follows:

(1) Lagrange equation (similar to Eq. (10.4.5)) states

<span id="page-180-3"></span>
$$\frac{g_1(\alpha + h) - g_1(\alpha)}{h} = g_1'(\alpha + \theta h), \quad 0 < \theta < 1$$
 (10.4.15)

(2) Taking in Eq. (10.4.15)  $h = g_1(\alpha) - \alpha, h \neq 0$ , we obtain

<span id="page-180-4"></span>
$$g_1(\alpha + h) = g_1\{\alpha + [g_1(\alpha) - \alpha]\} = g_1(g_1(\alpha)) = \psi(\alpha)$$
 (10.4.16)

(3) Equations (10.4.15) and (10.4.16) yield

<span id="page-180-7"></span>
$$\frac{\psi(\alpha) - g_1(\alpha)}{g_1(\alpha) - \alpha} = g_1'\{\alpha + \theta[g_1(\alpha) - \alpha]\}$$
 (10.4.17)

(4) It follows from Eq. (10.4.16) that

<span id="page-180-5"></span>
$$g'_1(g_1(\alpha))g'_1(\alpha) = \psi'(\alpha)$$
 (10.4.18)

(5) The sought-for function  $g_1(\alpha)$  should not deviate substantially from a straight line at the interval h, and therefore we may take that

<span id="page-180-6"></span>
$$g_1'(\alpha) \approx g_1'[g_1(\alpha)] \approx g_1'[\alpha + \theta[g_1(\alpha) - \alpha]]$$
 (10.4.19)

(6) Equations (10.4.18) and (10.4.19) yield

<span id="page-180-8"></span>
$$g_1'(\alpha) \approx g_1'[g_1(\alpha)] \approx g_1'\{\alpha + \theta[g_1(\alpha) - \alpha]\} \approx \sqrt{\psi'(\alpha)}$$
 (10.4.20)

<span id="page-181-3"></span><span id="page-181-2"></span>(7) Considering Eqs. (10.4.17) and (10.4.20), we obtain

<span id="page-181-0"></span>
$$\frac{\psi(\alpha) - g_1(\alpha)}{g_1(\alpha) - \alpha} \approx \sqrt{\psi'(\alpha)}$$
 (10.4.21)

(8) Solution of Eq. (10.4.21) for  $g_1(\alpha)$  yields the following expression of  $g_1(\alpha)$ :

<span id="page-181-1"></span>
$$g_1(\alpha) \approx \frac{\psi(\alpha) + \alpha \sqrt{\psi'(\alpha)}}{1 + \sqrt{\psi'(\alpha)}}$$
 (10.4.22)

(9) Equation (10.4.22) is the approximate solution for functional

$$\psi(\alpha) = g_2(g_1(\alpha)) \tag{10.4.23}$$

The importance of Eq. (10.4.22) is that knowing  $\psi(\alpha)$ ,  $\alpha$ , and  $\psi'(\alpha)$ , it becomes possible to derive the coupled noncircular gears (Fig. 10.1.2).

The procedure of computation of centrodes provides that centrodes  $(\sigma_1^{(1)}, \sigma_1^{(2)})$  and  $(\sigma_2^{(1)}, \sigma_2^{(2)})$  are not identical. A procedure of derivation of coupled centrodes is proposed that allows exact generation of function  $\psi(\alpha)$ .

NUMERICAL EXAMPLE 10.4.1: GENERATION OF FUNCTION  $z = \ln u$ , 1 < u < 100, BY A GEAR DRIVE WITH n = 1 PAIR OF NONCIRCULAR GEARS. A gear drive based on one pair of noncircular gears (Fig. 10.1.1) is applied for function generation. Derivation of centrodes  $\sigma_1$  and  $\sigma_2$  is based on the following procedure:

(1) Intervals of rotation of the two centrodes are considered to be equal:

$$0 < \alpha < 10\pi/6$$
,  $0 < \psi < 10\pi/6$ 

(2) Angle of rotation of centrode  $\sigma_1^{(1)}$ ,  $\alpha$ , is proportional to independent variable u, and scalar coefficient  $k_1$  is determined from

$$\alpha = k_1(u - u_{min}) + \alpha_{min}$$

Here,  $u_{min} = 1$ ,  $\alpha_{min} = 0$  rad.

(3) Angle of rotation of centrode  $\sigma_2^{(2)}$ ,  $\psi$ , is proportional to dependent variable z, and scalar coefficient  $k_2$  is determined from

$$\psi = k_2(z - z_{min}) + \psi_{min}$$

Here,  $z_{min} = \ln 1$ ,  $\psi_{min} = 0$  rad.

(4) Scalar coefficients  $k_1$  and  $k_2$  are obtained as

$$k_1 = \frac{\alpha_{max} - \alpha_{min}}{u_{max} - u_{min}} = \frac{10\pi/6 - 0}{100 - 1}$$
$$k_2 = \frac{\psi_{max} - \psi_{min}}{z_{max} - z_{min}} = \frac{10\pi/6 - 0}{\ln 100 - \ln 1}$$

(5) Function  $\psi(\alpha)$  is represented as

$$\psi(\alpha) = k_2 \left[ \ln \left( \frac{\alpha - \alpha_{min}}{k_1} + u_{min} \right) - z_{min} \right] + \psi_{min}$$

<span id="page-182-1"></span><span id="page-182-0"></span>(6) Function  $\psi(\alpha)$  allows us to determine the centrodes  $\sigma_1$  and  $\sigma_2$  in their respective coordinate systems  $S_1$  and  $S_2$  as

$$r_{1} = E \frac{1}{1 + m_{12}} = E \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{\psi'(\alpha)}}$$

$$r_{2} = E - r_{1}^{(1)}$$

$$r_{1x} = -r_{1}^{(1)} \sin(\alpha - \alpha_{min})$$

$$r_{1y} = +r_{1}^{(1)} \cos(\alpha - \alpha_{min})$$

$$r_{2x} = -r_{2}^{(1)} \sin(\psi - \psi_{min})$$

$$r_{2y} = -r_{2}^{(1)} \cos(\psi - \psi_{min})$$

Here, E is the center distance chosen in this numerical example as E=400 mm.

Figure 10.1.1(a) shows the pair of centrodes, and Figure 10.1.1(b) shows the generated function  $\psi(\alpha)$ .

NUMERICAL EXAMPLE 10.4.2: GENERATION OF FUNCTION  $z = \ln u$ , 1 < u < 100, BY A GEAR DRIVE WITH n = 2 PAIRS OF NONCIRCULAR GEARS. A gear drive based on two pairs of noncircular gears with center distance E = 400 mm is applied for the purpose of function generation (see Fig. 10.1.2). Derivation of centrodes  $\sigma_1^{(1)}$ ,  $\sigma_2^{(1)}$ ,  $\sigma_1^{(2)}$ ,  $\sigma_2^{(2)}$  is based on the following procedure:

(1) Intervals of rotation of all centrodes are considered as equal:

$$0 < \alpha < 10\pi/6$$
,  $0 < \beta < 10\pi/6$ ,  $0 < \gamma < 10\pi/6$ ,  $0 < \psi < 10\pi/6$ 

(2) Angle of rotation of centrode  $\sigma_1^{(1)}$ ,  $\alpha$ , is proportional to independent variable u, and the scalar coefficient  $k_1$  is obtained from

$$\alpha = k_1(u - u_{min}) + \alpha_{min}$$

Here,  $u_{min} = 1$ ,  $\alpha_{min} = 0$  rad.

(3) Angle of rotation of centrode  $\sigma_2^{(2)}$ ,  $\psi$ , is proportional to dependent variable z, and the scalar coefficient  $k_2$  is obtained from

$$\psi = k_2(z - z_{min}) + \psi_{min}$$

Here,  $z_{min} = \ln 1$ ,  $\psi_{min} = 0$  rad.

(4) We then have

$$k_1 = \frac{\alpha_{max} - \alpha_{min}}{u_{max} - u_{min}} = \frac{10\pi/6 - 0}{100 - 1}$$
$$k_2 = \frac{\psi_{max} - \psi_{min}}{z_{max} - z_{min}} = \frac{10\pi/6 - 0}{\ln 100 - \ln 1}$$

<span id="page-183-3"></span><span id="page-183-1"></span><span id="page-183-0"></span>(5) Function  $\psi(\alpha)$  is derived as

$$\psi(\alpha) = k_2 \left[ \ln \left( \frac{\alpha - \alpha_{min}}{k_1} + u_{min} \right) - z_{min} \right] + \psi_{min}$$

- (6) Function  $\beta(\alpha) \equiv g_1(\alpha)$  generated by the first pair of centrodes is represented by Eq. (10.4.22).
- (7) Function  $g_1(\alpha)$  allows us to determine the centrodes  $\sigma_1^{(1)}$  and  $\sigma_2^{(1)}$  at their respective coordinate systems  $S_1$  and  $S_2$  as

$$r_{1} = E \frac{1}{1 + m_{12}} = E \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{g'_{1}(\alpha)}}$$

$$r_{2} = E - r_{1}^{(1)}$$

$$r_{1x} = -r_{1} \sin(\alpha - \alpha_{min})$$

$$r_{1y} = +r_{1} \cos(\alpha - \alpha_{min})$$

$$r_{2x} = -r_{2} \sin(\beta - \beta_{min})$$

$$r_{2y} = -r_{2} \cos(\beta - \beta_{min})$$

(8) Functions  $\psi(\alpha)$  and  $g_1(\alpha)$  allow us to determine the centrodes  $\sigma_1^{(2)}$  and  $\sigma_2^{(2)}$  at their respective coordinate systems  $S_3$  and  $S_4$  as

$$r_{3} = E \frac{1}{1 + m_{34}} = E \frac{1}{1 + \frac{g'_{1}(\alpha)}{\psi'(\alpha)}}$$

$$r_{4} = E - r_{1}^{(2)}$$

$$r_{3x} = -r_{3} \sin(\beta - \beta_{min})$$

$$r_{3y} = -r_{3} \cos(\beta - \beta_{min})$$

$$r_{4x} = -r_{4} \sin(\psi - \psi_{min})$$

$$r_{4y} = +r_{4} \cos(\psi - \psi_{min})$$

Figure 10.1.2(a) shows the two pairs of centrodes, and Fig. 10.1.2(b) shows the generated functions  $g_1(\alpha)$  and  $\psi(\alpha)$ .

#### <span id="page-183-2"></span>10.5 Design of Multigear Drive

### 10.5.1 Basic Equations

A multigear drive based on n pairs of noncircular gears must be designed for generation of a given function  $\psi(\alpha)$ . Here,  $\alpha$  is the angle of rotation of centrode 1, of pair 1, and  $\psi$  is the angle of rotation of driven centrode of pair n.

Functional (10.4.2) is used for generation of the given function  $\psi(\alpha)$ . The goal of this section is determination of functions  $g_k(\alpha)$  (see Eq. (10.4.2)) generated by each pair k, k = 1, ..., n, in the form

$$g_k = g_k(g_{k-1}, \psi(\alpha), \psi'(\alpha))$$
 (10.5.1)

Here,  $g_k$  is the angle of rotation of driven centrode 2k and  $g_{k-1}$  is the angle of rotation of centrode 2k-1 (the driving one). In the case that k=1,  $g_{k-1}=g_0=\alpha$  is the angle of rotation of centrode 1.

The procedure is as follows:

(1) Differentiation of Functional (10.4.2) provides that

$$\psi'(\alpha) = g'_n(g_{n-1}) \cdot g'_{n-1}(g_{n-2}) \cdot \dots \cdot g'_2(g_1) \cdot g'_1(\alpha)$$
 (10.5.2)

(2) We may assume that  $g'_n(g_{n-1}) \approx g'_{n-1}(g_{n-2}) \approx \ldots \approx g'_2(g_1) \approx g'_1(\alpha)$ . This assumption is based on the tendency of function  $g_k$  toward a straight line when n trends toward infinity. Then the following relations are observed:

<span id="page-184-0"></span>
$$g'_k(g_{k-1}) \approx [\psi'(\alpha)]^{1/n}, \quad k = 1, \dots, n$$
 (10.5.3)

(3) Considering now Lagrange's theorem for each function  $g_k(g_{k-1}), k = 1, ..., n$ ,

$$g'_{k}(g_{k-1} + \theta h_{k}) = \frac{g_{k}(g_{k-1} + h_{k}) - g_{k}(g_{k-1})}{h_{k}}, \quad 0 < \theta < 1$$
 (10.5.4)

and taking  $h_k = g_k(g_{k-1}) - g_{k-1}$ , we obtain

<span id="page-184-1"></span>
$$g'_{k}(g_{k-1} + \theta h_{k}) = \frac{g_{k}(g_{k-1} + g_{k}(g_{k-1}) - g_{k-1}) - g_{k}(g_{k-1})}{g_{k}(g_{k-1}) - g_{k-1}}$$
(10.5.5)

(4) Considering Eqs. (10.5.3) and (10.5.5), we may determine  $g_k$  as a function of  $g_{k-1}, g_{k+1}$ , and  $\psi'(\alpha)$ 

$$\frac{g_k(g_k(g_{k-1})) - g_k(g_{k-1})}{g_k(g_{k-1}) - g_{k-1}} \approx [\psi'(\alpha)]^{1/n}$$
(10.5.6)

In this equation,  $g_k(g_k(g_{k-1})) \approx g_{k+1}(g_k)$  so that

$$\frac{g_{k+1}(g_k) - g_k(g_{k-1})}{g_k(g_{k-1}) - g_{k-1}} \approx [\psi'(\alpha)]^{1/n}$$
(10.5.7)

and finally we can determine  $g_k(g_{k-1})$  as

<span id="page-184-2"></span>
$$g_k(g_{k-1}) \approx \frac{g_{k+1}(g_k) + g_{k-1}[\psi'(\alpha)]^{1/n}}{1 + [\psi'(\alpha)]^{1/n}}$$
 (10.5.8)

(5) By observing Eq. (10.5.8) from k = 1 to k = n - 1 and considering that  $g_n = \psi(\alpha)$  and  $g_0 = \alpha$ , the following general equation is determined:

<span id="page-184-3"></span>
$$g_k(\alpha) \approx \frac{\psi(\alpha) + g_{k-1} \left[ \sum_{j=1}^{j=n-k} [\psi'(\alpha)]^{j/n} \right]}{1 + \sum_{j=1}^{j=n-k} [\psi'(\alpha)]^{j/n}}, \quad k = 1, \dots, n-1$$

Design of the centrodes of noncircular gears requires determination of the gear ratio for each pair k (k = 1, ..., n) as

$$m_{2k-1,2k} = \frac{dg_{k-1}}{dg_k} = \frac{g'_{k-1}(\alpha)}{g'_k(\alpha)}, \quad k = 1, \dots, n$$
 (10.5.10)

Polar vectors are then obtained as

$$\mathbf{r}_{2k-1} = E \frac{1}{1 + m_{2k-1} \, 2k}, \quad k = 1, \dots, n$$
 (10.5.11)

$$r_{2k} = E - r_{2k-1}, \quad k = 1, ..., n$$
 (10.5.12)

Here, E is the center distance.

NUMERICAL EXAMPLE 10.5.1: GENERATION OF FUNCTION  $z = \ln u$ , 1 < u < 100 BY A GEAR DRIVE WITH n = 3 PAIRS OF NONCIRCULAR GEARS. The procedure for determination of the six centrodes is as follows:

(1) The functional

$$\psi(\alpha) = g_3(g_2(g_1(\alpha))) \tag{10.5.13}$$

is formed by three functions generated by three pairs of centrodes. Centrodes  $\sigma_1^{(1)}$  and  $\sigma_2^{(1)}$  provide function  $g_1(\alpha)$ , centrodes  $\sigma_1^{(2)}$  and  $\sigma_2^{(2)}$  provide function  $g_2(\alpha)$ , and centrodes  $\sigma_1^{(3)}$  and  $\sigma_2^{(3)}$  provide function  $g_3(\alpha)$  (see Fig. 10.5.1). The centrodes are unclosed curves and the maximal angles of rotation of all six centrodes are equal and of  $10\pi/6$  radians.

(2) Angle of rotation of centrode  $\sigma_1^{(1)}$  is proportional to variable u, whereas angle of rotation of centrode  $\sigma_2^{(3)}$  is proportional to variable z:

$$\alpha = k_1(u - u_{min}) + \alpha_{min} = k_1(u - 1)$$
 (10.5.14)

$$\psi = k_2(\ln u - \ln u_{min}) + \psi_{min} = k_2 \ln u$$
 (10.5.15)

Here,  $\alpha_{min} = 0$  and  $\psi_{min} = 0$ .

(3) Coefficients  $k_1$  and  $k_2$  are determined as

$$k_1 = \frac{\alpha_{max} - \alpha_{min}}{u_{max} - u_{min}} = \frac{10\pi/6}{100 - 1}$$
$$k_2 = \frac{\psi_{max} - \psi_{min}}{\ln u_{max} - \ln u_{min}} = \frac{10\pi/6}{\ln 100 - \ln 1}$$

(4) Function  $\psi(\alpha)$  is then derived as

<span id="page-186-0"></span>
$$\psi(\alpha) = k_2 \left[ \ln \left( \frac{\alpha}{k_1} + 1 \right) - \ln 1 \right]$$
 (10.5.16)

(5) Function  $g_1(\alpha) \equiv \beta$  is determined by application of Eq. (10.5.9) with k = 1 and n = 3,

$$g_1(\alpha) = \frac{\psi(\alpha) + \alpha [\psi'(\alpha)]^{1/3} + \alpha [\psi'(\alpha)]^{2/3}}{1 + [\psi'(\alpha)]^{1/3} + [\psi'(\alpha)]^{2/3}}$$
(10.5.17)

wherein

$$\psi'(\alpha) = \frac{k_2}{\alpha + k_1} \tag{10.5.18}$$

(6) Function  $g_2(\alpha) \equiv \delta$  is determined by application of Eq. (10.5.9) with k = 2 and n = 3,

$$g_2(\alpha) = \frac{\psi(\alpha) + g_1(\alpha)[\psi'(\alpha)]^{1/3}}{1 + [\psi'(\alpha)]^{1/3}}$$
(10.5.19)

(7) Centrodes  $\sigma_1^{(1)}$  and  $\sigma_2^{(1)}$  are determined in their coordinate systems  $S_1$  and  $S_2$  as

$$r_{1}(\alpha) = E \frac{1}{1 + m_{12}(\alpha)} = E \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{g'_{1}(\alpha)}}$$

$$r_{2}(g_{1}(\alpha)) = E - r_{1}(\alpha)$$

$$r_{1x} = -r_{1} \sin(\alpha - \alpha_{min})$$

$$r_{4}(g_{2}(g_{1}(\alpha))) = E - r_{3}(g_{1}(\alpha))$$

$$r_{3x} = -r_{3} \sin(g_{1}(\alpha) - g_{1}(\alpha_{min}))$$

$$r_{3y} = -r_{3} \cos(g_{1}(\alpha) - g_{1}(\alpha_{min}))$$

$$r_{4x} = -r_{4} \sin(g_{2}(g_{1}(\alpha)) - g_{2}(g_{1}(\alpha_{min})))$$

$$r_{4y} = +r_{4} \cos(g_{2}(g_{1}(\alpha)) - g_{2}(g_{1}(\alpha_{min})))$$

(9) Centrodes  $\sigma_1^{(3)}$  and  $\sigma_2^{(3)}$  are determined in their coordinate systems  $S_5$  and  $S_6$  as

$$r_{5}(g_{2}(g_{1}(\alpha))) = E \frac{1}{1 + m_{56}(g_{2}(g_{1}(\alpha)))} = E \frac{1}{1 + \frac{g_{2}'(\alpha)}{\psi'(\alpha)}}$$

$$r_{6}(\psi) = E - r_{5}(g_{2}(g_{1}(\alpha)))$$

$$r_{5x} = -r_{5} \sin(g_{2}(g_{1}(\alpha)) - g_{2}(g_{1}(\alpha_{min})))$$

$$r_{5y} = +r_{5} \cos(g_{2}(g_{1}(\alpha)) - g_{2}(g_{1}(\alpha_{min})))$$

$$r_{6x} = -r_{6} \sin(\psi(\alpha) - \psi(\alpha_{min}))$$

$$r_{6y} = -r_{6} \cos(\psi(\alpha) - \psi(\alpha_{min}))$$

Figure 10.1.4(b) shows the generated functions  $g_1(\alpha) \equiv \beta(\alpha)$ ,  $g_2(\alpha) \equiv \delta(\alpha)$ , and  $g_3(\alpha) \equiv \psi(\alpha)$ .

Figures 10.1.1, 10.1.2, and 10.1.4, show the influence of the number of the applied gear drives on the shape of centrodes. The main factor of the influence is the derivative of transmission function (Fig. 10.1.3).

This section covers the following examples of synthesis of mechanisms:

- (i) Generation of a function by a double-crank linkage coupled with two pairs of noncircular gears (Section 10.6.1).
- (ii) Tandem design of a crank-slider linkage coupled with modified elliptical gears (Section 10.6.2).
- (iii) Tandem design of a Scotch-Yoke mechanism coupled with noncircular and circular gears (Section 10.6.3).
- (iv) Tandem design of mechanism formed by two pairs of noncircular gears and racks (Section 10.6.4).

The combination of a planar linkage with noncircular gears is very useful for variation of output speed variation (Sections 10.6.2 and 10.6.3). However, in the case of generation of functions, the preferable design should be based on application of multigear drives formed by noncircular gears, but not a tandem design of a planar linkage with noncircular gears.

The disadvantage of the previously mentioned case (i) (wherein a planar linkage is coupled with noncircular gears for function generation) is the result of the substantial difference of the number of design parameters with respect to the design of multigear drives formed by noncircular gears, wherein the number of design parameter is much greater.

Apart of mechanisms represented in Sections 10.6.1 to 10.6.3, the mechanism formed by two pairs of racks and noncircular gears (Section 10.6.4) can be applied for variation of output speed and function generation. Application of two pairs of racks and noncircular gear allows obtaining larger magnitude of translational motion.

# <span id="page-188-2"></span>**10.6.1** Tandem Design of Double-Crank Mechanism Coupled with Two Pairs of Noncircular Gears

The limited number of design parameters of a four-bar linkage causes a handicap when a given function is required to be provided. In this sense, tandem design of the linkage with noncircular gears is helpful for reducing of the differences between the desired function and the governing function of the linkage (see numerical example later).

NUMERICAL EXAMPLE 10.6.1: APPROXIMATE GENERATION OF FUNCTION  $z = \ln u$ , 1 < u < 10, BY A FOUR-BAR LINKAGE AND TWO PAIRS OF NONCIRCULAR GEARS. Function  $z = \ln u$ , 1 < u < 10, is considered to be obtained through a tandem design based on two pairs of noncircular gears and a four-bar double-crank linkage. The applied functional is represented by  $\psi(\alpha) = g_3(g_2(g_1(\alpha)))$ , but the functional to be obtained is  $\psi^*(\alpha) = g_3^*(g_2(g_1(\alpha)))$ , wherein function  $g_3^*$  must be generated by a four-bar

linkage instead of function  $g_3$ , and functions  $g_1$  and  $g_2$  will be generated by two pairs of noncircular gears.

Rotation  $\alpha$  is proportional to independent variable u by application of coefficient  $k_1$ :

$$\alpha = k_1(u - u_{min}) + \alpha_{min} \tag{10.6.1}$$

Rotation  $\psi$  is proportional to dependent variable z by application of coefficient  $k_2$ :

$$\psi = k_2(z(u) - z(u_{min})) + \psi_{min}$$
 (10.6.2)

Function  $\psi(\alpha)$  is then derived as

$$\psi(\alpha) = k_2 \left[ \ln \left( \frac{\alpha - \alpha_{min}}{k_1} + u_{min} \right) - \ln u_{min} \right] + \psi_{min}$$
 (10.6.3)

The intervals of rotations are chosen as

$$\alpha_{min} = 0;$$
  $\alpha_{max} = 11\pi/6;$   $\psi_{min} = -2\pi/6;$   $\psi_{max} = 8\pi/6$ 

and provide coefficients  $k_1$  and  $k_2$ :

$$k_1 = \frac{\alpha_{max} - \alpha_{min}}{u_{max} - u_{min}} = \frac{11\pi/6 - 0}{10 - 1}$$
$$k_2 = \frac{\psi_{max} - \psi_{min}}{z_{max} - z_{min}} = \frac{8\pi/6 - (-2\pi/6)}{\ln 10 - \ln 1}$$

Function  $g_1(\alpha) \equiv \beta(\alpha)$  is derived as

$$g_1(\alpha) \equiv \beta(\alpha) = \frac{\psi(\alpha) + \alpha [\psi'(\alpha)]^{1/3} + \alpha [\psi'(\alpha)]^{2/3}}{1 + [\psi'(\alpha)]^{1/3} + [\psi'(\alpha)]^{2/3}}$$
(10.6.4)

wherein  $\psi'(\alpha)$  is given as

$$\psi'(\alpha) = \frac{k_2}{\alpha - \alpha_{min} + u_{min}k_1} \tag{10.6.5}$$

Function  $g_2(\alpha) \equiv \delta(\alpha)$  is given as

$$g_2(\alpha) \equiv \delta(\alpha) = \frac{\psi(\alpha) + g_1(\alpha)[\psi'(\alpha)]^{1/3}}{1 + [\psi'(\alpha)]^{1/3}}$$
(10.6.6)

For the synthesis of the linkage, three points of the function  $g_3 \equiv \psi(\theta)$  are considered, taking into account the roots of Chebyshev's polynomial

(Chebyshev, 1955):

$$\alpha_{1} = \frac{\alpha_{max} + \alpha_{min}}{2} - \frac{\alpha_{max} - \alpha_{min}}{2} \cos \frac{\pi}{6}$$

$$\alpha_{2} = \frac{\alpha_{max} + \alpha_{min}}{2}$$

$$\alpha_{3} = \frac{\alpha_{max} + \alpha_{min}}{2} - \frac{\alpha_{max} - \alpha_{min}}{2} \cos \frac{5\pi}{6}$$

$$\theta_{1} = g_{2}(g_{1}(\alpha_{1}))$$

$$\theta_{2} = g_{2}(g_{1}(\alpha_{2}))$$

$$\theta_{3} = g_{2}(g_{1}(\alpha_{3}))$$

$$\psi_{1} = \psi(\alpha_{1}) = k_{2} \left[ \ln \left( \frac{\alpha_{1}}{k_{1}} + 1 \right) - \ln 1 \right] - 2\pi/6$$

$$\psi_{2} = \psi(\alpha_{2}) = k_{2} \left[ \ln \left( \frac{\alpha_{2}}{k_{1}} + 1 \right) - \ln 1 \right] - 2\pi/6$$

$$\psi_{3} = \psi(\alpha_{3}) = k_{2} \left[ \ln \left( \frac{\alpha_{3}}{k_{1}} + 1 \right) - \ln 1 \right] - 2\pi/6$$

Considering the governing equation of the linkage

$$h(\theta, \psi^*, L_2, L_3, L_4) = 0$$

wherein  $L_2$ ,  $L_3$ ,  $L_4$  are the lengths of the three bars ( $L_1$  is considered equal to 1), a system of three equations and three unknowns may be stated (Waldron & Kinzel, 2004):

$$h_1(\theta_1, \psi_1^*, L_2, L_3, L_4) = 0$$
  

$$h_2(\theta_2, \psi_2^*, L_2, L_3, L_4) = 0$$
  

$$h_3(\theta_3, \psi_3^*, L_2, L_3, L_4) = 0$$

wherein  $\psi_1^* = \psi_1$ ,  $\psi_2^* = \psi_2$ ,  $\psi_3^* = \psi_3$ .

Solution of the system provides the lengths  $L_2$ ,  $L_3$ ,  $L_4$  as

$$L_2 = 6.33822;$$
  $L_3 = 1.27937;$   $L_4 = 6.07355;$ 

which may be scaled to any required dimension. For example, using a scale of 40,

$$L_1 = 40.00000;$$
  $L_2 = 253.52880;$   $L_3 = 51.17494;$   $L_4 = 242.94184;$ 

Solution of the governing equation provides  $\psi^*(\theta) \equiv g_3^*$ . Functions  $g_3^*$  and  $g_3$  coincide each other at points  $(\theta_1, \psi_1), (\theta_2, \psi_2), (\theta_3, \psi_3)$ .

The error function of the mechanism based on two pairs of noncircular gears and one four-bar linkage may be obtained as

$$\Delta \psi^* = \psi^*(\alpha) - \psi(\alpha) \tag{10.6.7}$$

<span id="page-191-4"></span><span id="page-191-3"></span><span id="page-191-1"></span><span id="page-191-0"></span>If we consider now that function ψ(α) must be provided by just a single four-bar linkage and we notify the function generated by the linkage as ψ∗∗(α), the error function is obtained as

$$\Delta \psi^{**} = \psi^{**}(\alpha) - \psi(\alpha) \tag{10.6.8}$$

Figure [10.6.1\(](#page-192-0)a) shows the two pairs of noncircular gears coupled with the linkage at position (θ1,ψ1). Figure [10.6.1\(](#page-192-0)b) shows the error functions ψ<sup>∗</sup>(α) − ψ(α) and ψ∗∗(α) − ψ(α). The standard deviation of error function ψ<sup>∗</sup>(α) − ψ(α) is 0.0545, whereas the standard deviation of error function ψ∗∗(α) − ψ(α) is 0.1430. The standard deviation may vary depending on chosen points (α*i*,ψ*i*), (*i* = 1, 2, 3); it depends as well on intervals of rotations for angles α and ψ.

#### <span id="page-191-2"></span>**10.6.2 Tandem Design of Slider-Crank Mechanism Coupled with Modified Elliptical Gears**

#### **10.6.2.1 Preliminary Information**

Tandem design of the linkage means that the rotation of the crank is provided by a pair of two modified elliptical gears with centrodes σ<sup>1</sup> and σ<sup>2</sup> (Fig. [10.6.2\(](#page-193-0)a)). Figure [10.6.2\(](#page-193-0)b) shows two functions: (i) symmetric function *s*(α) of slider 5 of a conventional crank-slider linkage, and (ii) asymmetric function *s*(φ1) of the linkage coupled with the pair of gears 1 and 2 (centrodes σ<sup>1</sup> and σ2).

Here, *s* represents the instantaneous position of slider 5; α determines the instantaneous position of the crank; φ<sup>1</sup> is the current position of centrode 1 with respect to the center distance *O*<sup>1</sup> − *O*<sup>2</sup> of the centrodes.

Function *s*(φ1) of slider 5 (Fig. [10.6.2\(](#page-193-0)a)) corresponds to two cycles of the work of the linkage (Fig. [10.6.2\(](#page-193-0)b)): the working cycle with lower velocity of the slider, and the free-running cycle with greater velocity. Such variation of the speed of the slider is obtained by application of modified elliptical gears (Fig. [10.6.2\(](#page-193-0)a)).

Function *s*(α) of a conventional crank-slider linkage with symmetric cycles (Fig. [10.6.3\)](#page-194-2) is determined as

$$s(\alpha) = -a\cos\alpha + \sqrt{b^2 - a^2\sin^2\alpha}$$
 (10.6.9)

where *a* and *b* are the lengths of the crank and connecting rod, respectively.

#### **10.6.2.2 Basic Ideas of Modification of Elliptical Centrodes**

The modification of elliptical centrodes is illustrated with Fig. [10.6.4,](#page-195-0) which shows modification of upper and lower branches of the modified centrode (Figs. [10.6.4\(](#page-195-0)a) and [10.6.4\(](#page-195-0)b), respectively).

Position vector *O*1*A*<sup>2</sup> of upper modified centrode (Fig. [10.6.4\(](#page-195-0)a)) is determined as

$$|\overline{O_1 A_2}| = |\overline{O_1 A_1}|, \qquad \frac{\phi_1}{m_I} \neq \phi_1$$

$$m_{II} = \frac{m_I}{2m_I - 1} \tag{10.6.12}$$

Branches  $\sigma_1^{(I)}$  and  $\sigma_1^{(II)}$  are shown in Fig. 10.6.4(c).

#### 10.6.2.3 Analytical Determination of Modified Elliptical Centrodes

The design of the elliptical centrodes is based on the application of derivative functions (Fig. 10.6.5)

$$m_{21}^{(I)}(\phi_1) = \frac{1 - e^2}{1 + e^2 - 2e\cos(m_I\phi_1)}, \qquad 0 \le \phi_1 \le \frac{\pi}{m_I} \quad (10.6.13)$$

$$m_{21}^{(II)}(\phi_1) = \frac{1 - e^2}{1 + e^2 - 2e\cos(m_{II}(2\pi - \phi_1))}, \qquad \frac{\pi}{m_I} \le \phi_1 \le 2\pi \quad (10.6.14)$$

$$\phi_2(\phi_1) = \int_0^{\phi_1} m_{21}(\phi_1) d\phi_1 \tag{10.6.18}$$

#### 10.6.2.4 Numerical Examples

Two examples of tandem design are considered with function  $s(\phi_1)$  shown in Fig. 10.6.2(b), and with function  $s(\phi_1)$  shown in Fig. 10.6.6(b).

The dimensions of the links of the crank-slider linkages for both cases of design are a=200 mm and b=300 mm. For case of design 1 (Fig. 10.6.2), the parameters of design of the elliptical centrodes are: major axis of ellipse 2a=120 mm; eccentricity e=0.5, coefficient of modification of branch  $\sigma_1^{(I)}$ ,  $m_I=1.5$ , and center distance E=2a=120 mm. For the case of design 2 (Fig. 10.6.6), link 3 of the crank-slider linkage is mounted with an offset angle  $\alpha_0$  with respect to the initial position of gear 2, where  $\alpha_0=2\pi/3$ .

Figure 10.6.2(a) shows the centrodes of the modified elliptical gears, and Fig. 10.6.2(b) shows functions  $s(\alpha)$  and  $s(\phi_1)$  of the slider-crank linkage. Longer approach and faster return strokes are obtained. The positions of the crank and centrode 2 are synchronized because  $\alpha = \phi_2$  (Fig. 10.6.2(b)).

In case of design 2 (Fig. 10.6.6(a)), there is an offset angle  $\alpha_0$  formed by the initial positions of crank 3 and gear 2. Such assembly affects the shape of governing function  $s(\phi_1)$ , as shown in Fig. 10.6.6(b).

The Scotch-Yoke mechanism in the proposed design is driven by a pair of noncircular gears 1 and 2 and two circular gears 3 and 4 (Fig. [10.6.7\(](#page-198-0)a)).

The purpose of tandem design of the Scotch-Yoke mechanism (coupled with gears) is to obtain an improved function of output velocity v7(φ1) (see Fig. [10.6.8\)](#page-199-0) with the following conditions:

- (i) Gear 1 (Fig. [10.6.7\(](#page-198-1)a)) is an eccentric involute gear and noncircular gear 2 is conjugated to gear 1.
- (ii) Gears 3 and 4 (Fig. [10.6.7\(](#page-198-1)a)) are circular gears with gear ratio of 2 (ω(3)/ω(4)) = 2); gear 4 performs one revolution for two revolutions of gear 3.
- (iii) Function v7(φ1) is of a period φ<sup>1</sup> = 2π, and this is obtained by application of circular gears 3 and 4 in addition to eccentric circular gear 1 and noncircular gear 2.

The basic kinematic relation of the coupled mechanism is based on the drawings of Fig. [10.6.7.](#page-198-1) Figure [10.6.7\(](#page-198-1)a) shows the initial position of links at φ<sup>1</sup> = 0.

The basic kinematic relations of the velocities of the links of the mechanism are represented by

$$v_7 = \omega_5 r_5 \sin \phi_5 \tag{10.6.19}$$

wherein φ<sup>5</sup> is the angle of rotation of the crank. Such a relation is a sine-type function.

wherein *m*21(φ1) is determined as (see [Litvin](#page-219-3) *et al.*, 2008)

<span id="page-200-4"></span>
$$m_{21} = \frac{c_1}{c_1 - \left(1 - \varepsilon_1^2 \sin^2 \phi_1\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} - \varepsilon_1 \cos \phi_1} - 1$$
 (10.6.21)

Here, *<sup>c</sup>*<sup>1</sup> <sup>=</sup> *<sup>E</sup> r <sup>p</sup>*<sup>1</sup> , <sup>ε</sup><sup>1</sup> <sup>=</sup> *<sup>e</sup>*<sup>1</sup> *r <sup>p</sup>*<sup>1</sup> , wherein *E* is the center distance of the eccentric gear drive, *r <sup>p</sup>*<sup>1</sup> [is the pitch radius of the eccentric gear,](#page-219-3) *e*<sup>1</sup> is the eccentricity (see Litvin *et al.*, 2008).

Angle of rotation φ<sup>5</sup> is also derived as

<span id="page-200-5"></span>
$$\phi_5 = \phi_4 = m_{43}\phi_3 = m_{43}\phi_2 = m_{43}\left(\int_0^{2\pi} m_{21}d\phi_1\right)$$
 (10.6.22)

Equations [\(10.6.20\)](#page-200-3), [\(10.6.21\)](#page-200-4), and [\(10.6.22\)](#page-200-5) yield

$$v_7 = m_{43} m_{21} \omega_1 r_5 \sin \left( m_{43} \left( \int_0^{2\pi} m_{21} d\phi_1 \right) \right)$$
 (10.6.23)

Figure [10.6.8\(](#page-199-1)a) shows the velocity function v7(φ1) for various values of parameter of eccentricity ε1. A flat function is obtained with ε<sup>1</sup> ≈ 0.1. Figures [10.6.8\(](#page-199-1)b) and (c) show textile balls when ε<sup>1</sup> = 0.1 and ε<sup>1</sup> = 0. Figure [10.6.8\(](#page-199-1)b) shows an optimized solution for the volume of wrapped strap around the ball with respect to the solution shown in Fig. [10.6.8\(](#page-199-1)c).

Application of elliptical gears instead of an eccentric gear drive is also possible. Tandem design based on two pairs of elliptical gears and a Scotch-Yoke mechanism provides the following expression for the velocity v7:

$$v_7 = m_{43}m_{21}\omega_1 r_5 \sin\left(m_{43} \cdot \arctan\left(\frac{1+e}{1-e}\tan\frac{\phi_1}{2}\right)\right)$$
 (10.6.24)

wherein *m*<sup>21</sup> is given by (see [Litvin](#page-219-8) *et al.*, 2007)

$$m_{21} = \frac{1 - e^2}{1 + e^2 - 2e\cos\phi_1} \tag{10.6.25}$$

and *e* is the eccentricity of the ellipse.

Figure 10.6.11. Two pairs of gears with noncircular gears 1 and 4 and racks 2 and 3.

<span id="page-202-0"></span>The basic kinematic relations are obtained as follows. Figure 10.6.12(a) shows that rotation of link 1 with angular velocity  $\omega^{(1)}$  is transformed into translation of link 2 with linear velocity  $v^{(2)}$ . Point I of tangency of centrodes 1 and 2 is located on line  $O_1n$  that is perpendicular to  $x^{(2)}$ ; point I moves along  $O_1n$  in the process of transformation of motions (Figs. 10.6.12(a) and (c)). Point I traces in coordinate systems rigidly connected to links 1 and 2 centrodes  $\sigma_1$  and  $\sigma_2$  of the drive (Figs. 10.6.12(b) and (c)).

Centrode  $\sigma_1$  is a polar curve (Fig. 10.6.12(b)),  $O_1A_1$  is the polar axis, and  $\mathbf{r}_1(\phi_1)$  is the position vector of  $\sigma_1$ .

Centrode  $\sigma_2$  is represented in coordinate system  $S_2(x_2, y_2)$ , and the position vector  $\mathbf{r}_2(\phi_1)$  of  $\sigma_2$  is represented by two components:  $\overline{O_2O_1} = \int_0^{\phi_1} ds_2$ , and  $\overline{O_1I}$  (Fig. 10.6.12(c)) Centrodes  $\sigma_1$  and  $\sigma_2$  roll over each other in the process of meshing.

Centrode  $\sigma_1$  of noncircular gear is a polar curve, and the position vector  $\mathbf{r}_1(\phi_1) = \overline{O_1 I}$  forms angle  $\phi_1$  with the polar axis  $\overline{O_1 A_1}$ . The magnitude of  $\mathbf{r}_1(\phi_1)$  is determined by the ratio

$$r_1(\phi_1) = \frac{v^{(2)}}{\omega^{(1)}} = \frac{ds_2}{d\phi_1}$$
 (10.6.26)

The position vector  $\overline{O_2I}$  of centrode  $\sigma_2$  is determined as

$$\mathbf{r}_{2}(\phi_{1}) = \int_{0}^{\phi_{1}} ds_{2} \mathbf{i}_{2} + \mathbf{r}_{1}(\phi_{1}) \mathbf{j}$$

#### **10.6.4.1 Generation of Function**

A gear drive formed by a rack and noncircular gear may be applied for generation of function *z* = *z*(*u*), *umin* < *u* < *umax*. The angle of rotation of centrode σ<sup>1</sup> and displacement of centrode σ<sup>2</sup> are represented as

$$\phi_1 = k_1(u - u_{min}) + \phi_{1,min}, \quad s_2 = k_2[z(u) - z(u_{min})] + s_{2,min}$$
 (10.6.28)

Centrode σ<sup>1</sup> (of noncircular gear) is a polar curve (*O*1*A*<sup>1</sup> is the polar axis) and is represented (Fig. [10.6.12\)](#page-203-3) as

<span id="page-203-4"></span>
$$r_1(u) = \frac{k_2}{k_1} [z'(u)], \quad \phi_1(u) = k_1(u - u_{min}) + \phi_{1,min}$$
 (10.6.29)

<span id="page-204-3"></span><span id="page-204-2"></span>![](_page_204_Figure_2.jpeg)

<span id="page-204-1"></span>Figure 10.6.13. For generation of function  $z = \ln u$ , 1 < u < 5, by a gear drive formed by a rack and noncircular gear.

Centrode  $\sigma_2$  (of the rack) is represented in coordinate system  $(y_2, x_2)$  as

<span id="page-204-0"></span>
$$x_2(u) = k_2[z(u) - z(u_{min})] + s_{2,min}, \quad y_2(u) = r_1(u) - r_1(u_{min}) = \frac{k_2}{k_1}[z'(u) - z'(u_{min})]$$
(10.6.30)

Coefficients  $k_1$  and  $k_2$  are the scale ones. Centrode  $\sigma_1$  is usually an unclosed curve, and the maximal angle of rotation of the noncircular gear is  $\phi_{1,max} < 2\pi$ .

NUMERICAL EXAMPLE 10.6.1: GENERATION OF FUNCTION  $z = \ln u$ , 1 < u < 5, BY A GEAR DRIVE FORMED BY A RACK AND NONCIRCULAR GEAR. The procedure of determination of centrodes is as follows:

(1) Intervals of rotation for centrode  $\sigma_1$  and displacement for centrode  $\sigma_2$  are

$$0 < \phi_1 < \frac{10\pi}{6} \tag{10.6.31}$$

$$0 < s_2 < 50 \frac{10\pi}{6} \tag{10.6.32}$$

(2) Coefficients  $k_1$  and  $k_2$  are determined as

$$k_1 = \frac{\phi_{1,max} - \phi_{1,min}}{u_{max} - u_{min}} = \frac{10\pi/6}{5 - 1}$$
 (10.6.33)

$$k_2 = \frac{s_{2,max} - s_{2,min}}{\ln u_{max} - \ln u_{min}} = \frac{50 \frac{10\pi}{6}}{\ln 5}$$
 (10.6.34)

(3) Applications of Eqs. (10.6.29) and (10.6.30) provide representation of centrodes  $\sigma_1$  and  $\sigma_2$ , respectively (see Fig. 10.6.13).

## **Additional Numerical Problems**

<span id="page-205-3"></span>Problem 11.1. Function f(x) = x,  $1 \le x \le 10$ , to be generated by a mechanism of noncircular gears mounted with a center distance of E = 100 mm is given. Compute the centrodes and represent their graphs. The centrodes will be non-closed curves wherein  $(\phi_1)_{max} = (\phi_2)_{max} = 10\pi/6$ .

According to Eqs. (2.4.6) and (2.4.7), the angles of rotation of the driving and driven gears are

$$\phi_1 = k_1(x - 1) \tag{11.1.1}$$

$$\phi_2 = k_2[f(x) - f(1)] = k_2[x - 1] \tag{11.1.2}$$

wherein f(x) = x and f(1) = 1, according to the given function. The gear ratio is determined as (Eq. (2.4.8))

<span id="page-205-2"></span>
$$m_{12}(x) = \frac{d\phi_1}{d\phi_2} = \frac{k_1}{k_2 f'(x)} = \frac{k_1}{k_2}$$
 (11.1.3)

As mentioned previously,  $(\phi_1)_{max} = (\phi_2)_{max} = \frac{10\pi}{6}$  for x = 10, so

$$(\phi_1)_{max} = \frac{10\pi}{6} = k_1(10 - 1) = 9k_1 \tag{11.1.4}$$

and therefore

$$k_1 = \frac{10\pi}{54} \tag{11.1.5}$$

Similarly, constant  $k_2$  is obtained as

$$k_2 = \frac{10\pi}{54} \tag{11.1.6}$$

The gear ratio according to Eq. (11.1.3) is

$$m_{12}(x) = \frac{d\phi_1}{d\phi_2} = \frac{k_1}{k_2} = 1 \tag{11.1.7}$$

as expected for generation of the lineal function f(x) = x.

Figure 11.1.1. Centrodes of gears generating function f(x) = x.

Centrode 1 is determined by

$$r_1(\phi_1) = \frac{E}{1 + m_{12}(\phi_1)} = \frac{E}{2}$$
 (11.1.8)

which corresponds to a circle of constant radius E/2. Centrode 2 is determined by

$$r_2(\phi_1) = E \frac{m_{12}(\phi_1)}{1 + m_{12}(\phi_1)} = E \frac{1}{2} = \frac{E}{2}$$
 (11.1.9)

which also corresponds to a circle of constant radius E/2. The rotation angles of gear 2 and 1 are determined by

$$\phi_2(\phi_1) = \int_0^{\phi_1} \frac{d\phi_1}{1} = \int_0^{\phi_1} d\phi_1 = \phi_1$$
 (11.1.10)

The centrodes corresponding to generation of function f(x) = x are represented by Fig. 11.1.1.

Problem 11.2. Function  $f(x) = x^2$ ,  $1 \le x \le 10$ , to be generated by a mechanism of noncircular gears is given. Compute the centrodes and represent their graphs for the same conditions that for Problem 11.1, wherein E = 100 mm and  $(\phi_1)_{max} = (\phi_2)_{max} = 10\pi/6$ .

The angles of rotation of the driving and driven gears are

<span id="page-207-0"></span>
$$\phi_1 = k_1(x - 1) \tag{11.2.1}$$

$$\phi_2 = k_2[x^2 - 1] \tag{11.2.2}$$

wherein  $f(x) = x^2$  and  $f(x_1) = 1$ .

According to the conditions of the problem,  $(\phi_1)_{max} = (\phi_2)_{max} = \frac{10\pi}{6}$  for x = 10, so

$$(\phi_1)_{max} = \frac{10\pi}{6} = k_1(10 - 1) = 9k_1$$
 (11.2.3)

and therefore

$$k_1 = \frac{10\pi}{6 \cdot 9} \tag{11.2.4}$$

Similarly,

$$(\phi_2)_{max} = \frac{10\pi}{6} = k_2(10^2 - 1) = k_1 \cdot 99$$
 (11.2.5)

and therefore

$$k_2 = \frac{10\pi}{6 \cdot 99} \tag{11.2.6}$$

The gear ratio is given by

$$m_{12}(x) = \frac{d\phi_1}{d\phi_2} = \frac{k_1}{k_2 f'(x)} = \frac{k_1}{2k_2 x}$$
 (11.2.7)

From Eq. (11.2.1)

$$x = \frac{\phi_1}{k_1} + 1 \tag{11.2.8}$$

so that the gear ratio may be expressed by a function of  $\phi_1$  as

<span id="page-207-1"></span>
$$m_{12}(\phi) = \frac{d\phi_1}{d\phi_2} = \frac{k_1}{2k_2x} = \frac{k_1^2}{2k_1k_2 + 2k_2\phi_1} = \frac{k_1^2}{2k_2(k_1 + \phi_1)}$$
(11.2.9)

Centrode 1 is determined as

$$r_1(\phi_1) = \frac{E}{1 + m_{12}(\phi_1)} \tag{11.2.10}$$

where  $m_{12}(\phi_1)$  is determined by Eq. (11.2.9). Centrode 2 is determined as

$$r_2(\phi_1) = E \frac{m_{12}(\phi_1)}{1 + m_{12}(\phi_1)}$$
 (11.2.11)

The rotation angles of gear 2 and 1 are related by

$$\phi_2(\phi_1) = \int_0^{\phi_1} \frac{d\phi_1}{m_{12}(\phi_1)} = \int_0^{\phi_1} \frac{2k_2 x}{k_1} d\phi_1 = \int_0^{\phi_1} \frac{2k_2 \left(\frac{\phi_1}{k_1} + 1\right)}{k_1} d\phi_1 = \frac{k_2 \phi_1(\phi_1 + 2k_1)}{k_1^2}$$

#### <span id="page-208-0"></span>**Problem 11.3. Derive the centrodes for generation of function**

$$\tan\left(\frac{\phi_2}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{1-e}{1+e}\right)\tan\left(\frac{\phi_1}{2}\right)$$

**Consider** *φ***<sup>1</sup>***max* **=** *φ***<sup>2</sup>***max* **= 2***π* **and** *E* **= 100 mm.**

According to Section [2.4,](#page-38-6) we meet the conditions of Case 1 wherein the derivative function *m*12(φ1) = *d*φ1/*d*φ<sup>2</sup> and the center distance of the gear drive with noncircular gears are given or known. The to-be-generated function is transformed into

$$\phi_2 = 2 \arctan \left[ \left( \frac{1-e}{1+e} \right) \tan \left( \frac{\phi_1}{2} \right) \right]$$
 (11.3.1)

allowing further derivations.

The derivative *d*φ2/*d*φ<sup>1</sup> must be determined toward determination of the derivative function *m*12(φ1)

$$\frac{d\phi_2}{d\phi_1} = \frac{1 - e^2}{1 + e^2 + 2e\cos\phi_1}$$

and therefore

$$m_{12}(\phi_1) = \frac{d\phi_1}{d\phi_2} = \frac{1 + e^2 + 2e\cos\phi_1}{1 - e^2}$$
 (11.3.3)

Centrode  $\sigma_1$  is determined by

$$r_1(\phi_1) = \frac{E}{1 + m_{12}(\phi_1)} \tag{11.3.4}$$

Centrode  $\sigma_2$  is determined by

$$r_2(\phi_1) = E \frac{m_{12}(\phi_1)}{1 + m_{12}(\phi_1)}$$
(11.3.5)

$$\phi_2(\phi_1) = \int_0^{\phi_1} \frac{d\phi_1}{m_{12}(\phi_1)} = 2 \arctan\left[\left(\frac{1-e}{1+e}\right) \tan\left(\frac{\phi_1}{2}\right)\right]$$
(11.3.6)

Figure 11.3.1 shows the centrodes of noncircular gears generating the function  $\tan\left(\frac{\phi_2}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{1-e}{1+e}\right)\tan\left(\frac{\phi_1}{2}\right)$  for two cases of design wherein the eccentricity of the ellipse is (a) e = 0.4 and (b) e = 0.8. For all cases of design, a center distance E = 100 mm has been considered.

#### Problem 11.4. Derive the centrodes for generation of the function

$$\phi_2 = b\phi_1 - a\cos\phi_1$$

![](_page_210_Picture_2.jpeg)

Figure 11.4.1. Centrodes of noncircular gears generating the function φ<sup>2</sup> = *b*φ<sup>1</sup> − *a* cos φ<sup>1</sup> wherein *b*/*a* = 1.8, *a* = 1/1.8, and *E* = 100 mm.

# **Choose** *b/a* **= 1***.***8 and determine** *a* **for providing a closed centrode for gear 2.**

Solution:

$$\frac{d\phi_2}{d\phi_1} = b + a\sin\phi_1\tag{11.4.1}$$

$$m_{12}(\phi_1) = \frac{d\phi_1}{d\phi_2} = \frac{1}{b + a\sin\phi_1}$$
 (11.4.2)

$$r_1(\phi_1) = \frac{E}{1 + m_{12}(\phi_1)}, \qquad r_2(\phi_1) = E \frac{m_{12}(\phi_1)}{1 + m_{12}(\phi_1)}$$
 (11.4.3)

<span id="page-210-0"></span>
$$\phi_2(\phi_1) = \int_0^{\phi_1} \frac{d\phi_1}{m_{12}(\phi_1)} = a + b\phi_1 - a\cos\phi_1$$
 (11.4.4)

Equation [\(11.4.4\)](#page-210-0), considering the conditions of design of centrodes as closed form curves (Section [2.6\)](#page-41-6), yields

$$\phi_2 = 2\pi = \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{d\phi_1}{m_{12}(\phi_1)} = a + 2\pi b - a = 2\pi b$$
 (11.4.5)

Therefore, to obtain a closed form centrode, *b* = 1, and according to the problem condition *b*/*a* = 1.8, we obtain *a* = 1/1.8. The centrodes of gear 1 and gear 2 are represented in Fig. [11.4.1.](#page-206-0)

Problem 11.5. Following functions are given:

$$(a) \ \frac{d\phi_2}{d\phi_1} = a + b\cos\phi_1$$

**(b)** 
$$\frac{d\phi_2}{d\phi_1} = \frac{1}{a + b\cos\phi_1}$$

Determine the centrodes of the respective noncircular gears that will generate such functions, and obtain the relation between parameters a and b to obtain closed centrodes for gear 1 and 2. Consider the center distance E=100 mm.

For function (a), the gear ratio is given by

$$m_{12}(\phi_1) = \frac{d\phi_1}{d\phi_2} = \frac{1}{a + b\cos\phi_1}$$
 (11.5.1)

The relation between the angles of rotation of gear 1 and gear 2 is given by

<span id="page-211-0"></span>
$$\phi_2(\phi_1) = \int_0^{\phi_1} \frac{d\phi_1}{m_{12}(\phi_1)} = a \,\phi_1 + b \,\sin\phi_1 \tag{11.5.2}$$

Equation (11.5.2), for  $\phi_1 = 2\pi$ ,  $\phi_2 = 2\pi$ , is the condition of obtaining a closed centrode for gear 2. Equation (11.5.2) with  $\phi_1 = \phi_2 = 2\pi$  yields a = 1.0. The shape of the centrodes depends on parameter b. Figure 11.5.1 shows centrodes for different values of parameter b.

We consider as well generation of  $\phi_2 = a\phi_1 - b\sin\phi_1$ . The difference with respect to generation of  $\phi_2 = a\phi_1 + b\sin\phi_1$  is just the position of the polar axis that is turned an angle of 180° (see Fig. 11.5.2).

For function (b), the gear ratio is given by

$$m_{12}(\phi_1) = \frac{d\phi_1}{d\phi_2} = a + b\cos\phi_1$$
 (11.5.3)

The relation between the angles of rotation of gear 1 and gear 2 is given by

<span id="page-211-1"></span>
$$\phi_2(\phi_1) = \int_0^{\phi_1} \frac{d\phi_1}{m_{12}(\phi_1)} = \int_0^{\phi_1} \frac{d\phi_1}{a + b\cos\phi_1}$$
 (11.5.4)

The solution of the integral in Eq. (11.5.4), (see Dwight, 1961) is

$$\phi_2(\phi_1) = \int \frac{d\phi_1}{a + b\cos\phi_1} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{a^2 - b^2}} \arctan\frac{(a - b)\tan\frac{\phi_1}{2}}{\sqrt{(a^2 - b^2)}}, \qquad a^2 > b^2 \quad (11.5.5)$$

The conditions to obtain a closed centrode for gear 2 are  $a^2 > b^2$  and  $a^2 - b^2 = 1.0$ . The function represented in Problem 11.3 is a particular case of function (b) wherein parameter  $a = (1 + e^2)/(1 - e^2)$  and parameter  $b = 2e/(1 - e^2)$ . Figure 11.5.3 shows the centrodes generating function (b) for different values of parameter b, observing for all cases that  $a = \sqrt{1 + b^2}$ .

Problem 11.6. For the same conditions of Problem 11.2, determine the curvatures of centrodes 1 and 2 and determine the condition of convexity of centrode 2. In case of obtaining a nonconvex centrode, determine the conditions of avoiding it.

<span id="page-213-1"></span>The centrodes of the noncircular gears generating the function *f*(*x*) = *x*<sup>2</sup> are represented in Fig. [11.6.1\(](#page-206-1)a). It may be observed that a small part of centrode 2 does not observe the condition of convexity.

The condition of convexity of centrodes is determined by observation of following conditions:

(i) For centrode 1 as

$$h_1(\phi_1) = 1 + m_{12}(\phi_1) + m_{12}''(\phi_1) \ge 0$$
 (11.6.1)

(ii) For centrode 2 as

<span id="page-213-0"></span>
$$h_2(\phi_1) = 1 + m_{12}(\phi_1) + \left[m'_{12}(\phi_1)\right]^2 - m_{12}(\phi_1)m''_{12}(\phi_1) \ge 0$$
 (11.6.2)

The conditions of convexity of centrode 2 as a function of φ<sup>2</sup> are represented in Fig. [11.6.1\(](#page-206-1)b). The conditions of convexity for centrode 2 are not observed from φ<sup>2</sup> = 0 to φ<sup>2</sup> = 0.217 rad. Centrode 2 is concave for the mentioned interval of φ2.

The curvatures of centrode 1 and 2 are represented in Figs. [11.6.1\(](#page-206-1)c) and (d) as functions of φ<sup>1</sup> and φ2, respectively. Figure [11.6.1\(](#page-206-1)d) shows the following:

- (i) The curvature changes its sign, and therefore centrode 2 has a point with curvature equal to zero.
- (ii) The centrode at such a point changes its shape from concave to convex.

Figure [11.6.1\(](#page-206-1)b) shows that the condition of convexity equal to zero is obtained for φ<sup>2</sup> = 0.217 rad. This condition coincides as well with the point wherein the curvature of centrode 2 changes its sign, represented by Fig. [11.6.1\(](#page-206-1)b).

To avoid the area of concavity of centrode 2, three approaches may be applied:

- (a) Change the interval of definition of function *z* = *u*2. Currently, the interval 1 ≤ *u* ≤ 10 is applied. By application of theory in Sections [2.8](#page-44-4) and [2.9,](#page-47-8) it is observed that for the interval 1 ≤ *u* ≤ 4.62, both centrodes 1 and 2 observe the conditions of convexity (Fig. [11.6.2\(](#page-213-1)a))
- (b) By extension of maximum angles of rotation of centrodes 1 and 2. For φ<sup>1</sup>*max* = 25π/4 and φ<sup>2</sup>*max* = 25π/4, centrode 2 observes the condition of convexity (Fig. [11.6.2\(](#page-213-1)b))
- (c) Using more than one pair of noncircular gears (see Section [10.5\)](#page-183-2).
