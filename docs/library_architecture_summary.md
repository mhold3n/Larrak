## 🔮 Future Extensions

### **Combustion Physics Integration**

The new architecture enables easy integration of combustion physics:

```python
from campro.physics import CombustionModel
from campro.constraints import CombustionConstraints
from campro.optimization import PhysicsOptimizer

# Create combustion model
combustion = CombustionModel()
combustion.configure(
    cylinder_volume=500e-6,  # 500cc
    compression_ratio=10.5,
    fuel_type="gasoline"
)

# Define combustion constraints
constraints = CombustionConstraints(
    max_pressure=100e5,  # 100 bar
    max_temperature=2500,  # K
    valve_timing_bounds=(0, 720)  # degrees
)

# Optimize with physics
optimizer = PhysicsOptimizer()
result = optimizer.optimize_combustion(
    combustion_model=combustion,
    constraints=constraints,
    objective="max_efficiency"
)
```

### **Multi-Domain Optimization**

Support for optimization across multiple domains:

```python
# Combine motion and combustion optimization
motion_result = motion_optimizer.solve_cam_motion_law(motion_constraints)
combustion_result = physics_optimizer.optimize_combustion(combustion_constraints)

# Joint optimization
joint_result = optimizer.optimize_joint(
    motion_constraints=motion_constraints,
    combustion_constraints=combustion_constraints,
    coupling_constraints=coupling_constraints
)
```
